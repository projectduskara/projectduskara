# Duskara: Whispers of Dusk

A Solo RPG of Memory and Endurance

v.2.0 - 2025-11-12  

## Introduction

You are a lineage of **Archivists**, custodians of Duskaran history who chronicle the shifting tides of civilization across generations. Your ancestors built wind-cities along the twilight belt, carved sanctuaries in geothermal caverns, and survived where they were never meant to thrive. Eight centuries after the *Stellar Horizon* crashed on this tidally locked world, their descendants struggle to preserve what matters.

The past is fluid. Some histories are lost, others reinterpreted, and each Archivist must decide what to remember, what to alter, and what to let fade into silence. Through your lineage, the evolving identity of Duskaran civilization will be told.

This is a game about **recording history**, **interpreting change**, and **shaping memory** across the span of centuries.

## The World of Duskara

Duskara is a tidally locked planet where one face eternally burns under a K-class star while the other freezes in perpetual darkness. Only the **twilight belt**—a narrow band 200-300 kilometers wide—supports human life.

### The Three Faces

**The Day Side**: A radiation-scorched wasteland where temperatures exceed 400°C. Robotic mining operations extract rare materials from the margins, but human presence is impossible. The extreme heat drives the planetary winds that define all life in the twilight belt.

**The Twilight Belt**: The habitable zone where 80% of Duskara's population lives. Linear cities stretch along this narrow band, their architecture shaped by constant winds. Settlements cluster around geothermal vents, underground aquifers, and wind-harvesting arrays. Temperatures range from -5°C to 40°C depending on proximity to day or night. Superstorms are frequent. Water is precious.

**The Night Side**: A frozen abyss where ice sheets kilometers thick cover the surface. Temperatures plunge below -100°C. Life exists only in deep caverns warmed by geothermal activity, where cave-dwelling communities have developed their own distinct culture, trading with twilight settlements through the Deep Roads—ancient tunnel networks that span the dark.

### Human Adaptation

Eight centuries of exposure to Duskara's environment have awakened latent psychic abilities in its people:

- **Thermal sensing**: Reading temperature gradients and heat signatures
- **Weather working**: Limited influence over local wind patterns
- **Deep bonding**: Psychic connection to native life forms

Technology balances preserved Earth knowledge with necessity-born innovation. Wind turbines and thermal exchangers power civilization. Ancient satellites orbit overhead, their purposes half-forgotten. Water reclamation is sacred. Every settlement is a fortress against the wind.

## Creating Your Chronicle

Before beginning, establish the foundation of your chronicle.

### What Are You Recording?

You chronicle the **history of Duskaran civilization** through the eyes of successive Archivists. Each generation inherits incomplete records, must interpret new events, and chooses what knowledge to preserve or suppress.

### Who Are the Archivists?

They are **memory-keepers** who serve in stone libraries, wander between settlements carrying wind-scrolls and data crystals, or hide in caves transcribing forbidden knowledge. Some Archivists serve ruling powers, others preserve truth in defiance of authority. Each generation brings new perspective.

### What Does the Archive Look Like?

The records take many forms:

- Wind-scrolls etched on treated fabric
- Stone tablets carved in sheltered alcoves  
- Memory-storing crystals (rare Earth tech)
- Oral traditions passed through song
- Digital fragments from before the crash

Some Archivists maintain all forms. Others specialize. Records are incomplete, contradictory, and contested.

### Time Scale

Each turn represents **one generation** (approximately 20-30 Earth years). The dating system uses **cycles**—a Duskaran orbital period of roughly 30-35 Earth days. By the present era (3000 CE), Duskara has experienced approximately 8,430 cycles since the crash (Cycle 0).

### What Changes Matter?

Track changes across multiple dimensions:

- **Material**: Resources, structures, technology, settlements
- **Cultural**: Traditions, beliefs, languages, customs  
- **Knowledge**: What is learned, lost, reinterpreted, or suppressed
- **Power**: Who rules, who resists, what factions emerge or fall

## Game Loop

### Step 1: Define the Current Archivist

At the start of each generation, establish the Archivist who will record this era. Roll on the d66 tables below or choose results that inspire you:

1. **Name** - What is this Archivist called?
2. **Title** - How are they known among their people?
3. **Form of Archive** - What medium do they use?
4. **A Truth They Preserve** - What knowledge do they fight to keep alive?
5. **A Secret They Carry** - What do they know but dare not record?

Each Archivist interprets events through their own perspective, biases, and the values of their time.

### Step 2: Roll d6 → Number of Events This Generation

Each generation experiences different levels of change:

- **1-2**: A quiet period—only **one** major event occurs
- **3-4**: **Two** significant events shape this era  
- **5-6**: **Three** events mark a time of upheaval or transformation

### Step 3: For Each Event

1. **Roll d66** to determine the major event (use the event table)
2. **Draw a card** from a standard deck for thematic interpretation (see card meanings in SRD)
3. **Write a chronicle entry** recording what happened and what it means
4. **Mark what changed** - note transformations in Duskaran civilization or the Archive itself

### Step 4: Advance Time

- Shift to the next Archivist generation
- Note how records were preserved, altered, or damaged in the transition
- Update the date (add ~20-30 years or ~250-400 cycles)
- Consider: What knowledge passed down? What was lost?

### Step 5: Continue Until the End

When the **Ace of Spades** is drawn, the chronicle approaches its conclusion. Play continues for 1-3 more generations, then write a final entry reflecting on the entire lineage of Archivists and what they preserved.

## Rolling a d66

To roll a **d66**, roll two six-sided dice (2d6):

- The first die represents the **tens place**
- The second die represents the **ones place**

Example: Rolling a **3** and a **5** gives **35**, producing results from **11 to 66**.

## Chronicle Entry Format

Each entry should include:

**1. Date & Archivist**  
*Format: "Archivist [Name], Cycle [Number], [Era/Location]"*  
Example: "Archivist Kael Thornvale, Cycle 5,200, Third Deep Roads Era"

**2. Event Summary**  
*1-3 sentences describing what occurred, influenced by d66 roll and card interpretation*

**3. Archivist's Reflection**  
*What does the Archivist think, feel, question, or notice? How does their perspective shape the account?*

**4. Mark What Changed**  
*What is different now? What was gained, lost, transformed, or preserved?*

### Example Entry

> **Archivist Maren Zephyros, Cycle 7,845, Late Consolidation Era**
>
> The settlement of Windward Spire collapsed during a superstorm, its foundations undermined by decades of erosion. Survivors fled to neighboring cities, carrying what records they could salvage. *(d66 = 42, 10 of Diamonds)*
> 
> **Reflection:** I interviewed three families who escaped. Each told different stories about why the warnings were ignored. The ruling council's archives were lost. We will never know if they knew the danger and chose silence, or if they were as blind as everyone else.
> 
> **Changed:** Windward Spire is now abandoned. Its population absorbed into three settlements—each of which now claims to be the "true heir" to its legacy. Already, the stories diverge. In twenty years, there will be three separate histories of what happened, and no way to reconcile them.

## Card Suit Interpretations

When you draw a card, use these Duskara-specific interpretations to add depth to the event. The suit provides the thematic lens, while the specific card adds nuance.

### A Truth They Preserve (d66)

| D66    | Truth                                                                               |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **11** | Humanity arrived on Duskara by accident, not by choice.                             |
| **12** | The *Stellar Horizon* was never meant to come here.                                 |
| **13** | Earth still exists somewhere among the stars.                                       |
| **14** | Psychic abilities emerged from environmental radiation, not divine gift.            |
| **15** | The original settlers spoke multiple Earth languages now mostly lost.               |
| **16** | Early Duskarans attempted to leave but failed.                                      |
| **21** | The crash killed thousands who never woke from cryogenic sleep.                     |
| **22** | Duskara's orbit may eventually decay or destabilize.                                |
| **23** | The first generation practiced strict genetic planning to ensure survival.          |
| **24** | Ancient power structures were far more authoritarian than admitted.                 |
| **25** | Early settlements failed repeatedly before stabilization occurred.                  |
| **26** | Cave dwellers were initially exiled criminals and dissidents.                       |
| **31** | Pre-crash Earth was experiencing environmental collapse.                            |
| **32** | Some of the original crew deliberately sabotaged the mission.                       |
| **33** | The Duskaran Accord was founded through violent conflict, not diplomacy.            |
| **34** | Weather working was initially feared and persecuted.                                |
| **35** | Early Archivists were executed for recording unpopular truths.                      |
| **36** | Entire settlements vanished without explanation in the early centuries.             |
| **41** | Native Duskaran life forms show signs of rudimentary intelligence.                  |
| **42** | The satellites still receive signals from an unknown source.                        |
| **43** | Some psychic abilities allow glimpses of alternative timelines.                     |
| **44** | The tidal lock occurred gradually over centuries, not instantaneously.              |
| **45** | Deep Roads were partially built by something other than humans.                     |
| **46** | Genetic engineering was practiced extensively in the first generations.             |
| **51** | The true purpose of the *Stellar Horizon* mission was never disclosed.              |
| **52** | Early Duskarans briefly achieved interplanetary flight before losing the knowledge. |
| **53** | A faction deliberately destroyed records of pre-crash Earth.                        |
| **54** | Weather working can influence human minds, not just wind patterns.                  |
| **55** | The original landing site contains technology too dangerous to recover.             |
| **56** | Some settlements practice selective breeding to enhance psychic abilities.          |
| **61** | The stars visible from Duskara do not match any known Earth constellations.         |
| **62** | Ancient treaties were signed under psychic coercion.                                |
| **63** | The Archivists once held absolute power over all settlements.                       |
| **64** | Deep beneath the night side, something vast and alive was detected.                 |
| **65** | Not all of Duskara's original settlers were human.                                  |
| **66** | The crash was not an accident.                                                      |

### A Secret They Carry (d66)

| D66    | Secret                                                                                                         |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **11** | They have falsified records to protect someone they love.                                                      |
| **12** | They discovered evidence that a revered historical figure was a tyrant.                                        |
| **13** | They possess a map to the *Stellar Horizon*'s intact core systems.                                             |
| **14** | They know the location of a forbidden archive but dare not access it.                                          |
| **15** | They have psychic abilities they hide from their community.                                                    |
| **16** | They inherited records proving their family's bloodline is fabricated.                                         |
| **21** | They witnessed a crime committed by a powerful leader.                                                         |
| **22** | They know a settlement's water supply will fail within a generation.                                           |
| **23** | They deciphered a warning in ancient Earth language: "Do not wake it."                                         |
| **24** | They discovered their predecessor Archivist was murdered, not naturally deceased.                              |
| **25** | They have been bribed to omit specific events from the chronicle.                                              |
| **26** | They possess a device that could restore Earth communication—but it would destroy a settlement's power supply. |
| **31** | They have psychic visions of the future but cannot prove their accuracy.                                       |
| **32** | They know who deliberately caused a major disaster.                                                            |
| **33** | They are recording events that never happened to cover up what truly occurred.                                 |
| **34** | They belong to a secret society that controls information across settlements.                                  |
| **35** | They found evidence that humans have lived on Duskara far longer than believed.                                |
| **36** | They know the exact date when the satellites will fail permanently.                                            |
| **41** | They possess pre-crash Earth music that contradicts official historical narrative.                             |
| **42** | They discovered their own birth was part of a genetic engineering program.                                     |
| **43** | They know which settlements will survive and which will fall—but cannot warn them.                             |
| **44** | They intercepted an encoded message from someone claiming to be off-world.                                     |
| **45** | They have been ordered to destroy specific records but have secretly preserved them.                           |
| **46** | They know the Duskaran Accord is preparing for civil war.                                                      |
| **51** | They possess a substance from the day side that grants temporary psychic enhancement.                          |
| **52** | They discovered their settlement was built atop a mass grave.                                                  |
| **53** | They have been recording in a language only they can read.                                                     |
| **54** | They know the true purpose of the Deep Roads—and it terrifies them.                                            |
| **55** | They possess a functioning Earth weapon that could devastate multiple settlements.                             |
| **56** | They are dying and have no successor to pass their knowledge to.                                               |
| **61** | They have proof that some psychic abilities are artificially induced through technology.                       |
| **62** | They know which Archivists altered historical records and why.                                                 |
| **63** | They discovered a chamber beneath their archive where voices speak in darkness.                                |
| **64** | They possess the only complete copy of Earth's cultural library.                                               |
| **65** | They have been communicating with an entity that lives in the planet's core.                                   |
| **66** | They are not the Archivist they claim to be.                                                                   |

## The Archivist's Legacy (d66)

*When an Archivist's tenure ends, roll to determine their final impact:*

| D66    | Legacy                                                                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **11** | Their most important work was immediately accepted and widely distributed.                        |
| **12** | They died before finishing their chronicle—their successor must interpret fragments.              |
| **13** | Their records were deemed heretical and ordered destroyed (some copies survive in secret).        |
| **14** | They trained three successors, each with a different interpretation of their methods.             |
| **15** | Their personal journals contradict their official archive—which is true?                          |
| **16** | They were celebrated as the most truthful Archivist of their age.                                 |
| **21** | They defaced previous archives to "correct" history—how much did they alter?                      |
| **22** | They hid their most important discovery where future Archivists might find it.                    |
| **23** | They were exiled but continued recording from the margins.                                        |
| **24** | Their successor burned everything they wrote and started fresh.                                   |
| **25** | They encoded secrets into their chronicle that took generations to decipher.                      |
| **26** | They became a legend—their actual work is now buried beneath myth.                                |
| **31** | They preserved knowledge that saved a settlement from catastrophe.                                |
| **32** | They falsified records so convincingly that no one will ever know.                                |
| **33** | They were assassinated for what they knew—the archive was scattered.                              |
| **34** | They deliberately created contradictory accounts to prevent any single truth from dominating.     |
| **35** | They vanished without explanation, leaving only cryptic final notes.                              |
| **36** | Their work was ignored during their lifetime but later rediscovered as prophetic.                 |
| **41** | They converted their archive into a religious text that shaped future beliefs.                    |
| **42** | They destroyed their own work in despair, believing all record-keeping to be futile.              |
| **43** | They maintained multiple secret archives, each containing different "truths."                     |
| **44** | They were the last Archivist of their settlement before it fell.                                  |
| **45** | Their successor discovered they had been systematically lying for decades.                        |
| **46** | They became a political figure, using the archive as a tool of power.                             |
| **51** | They spent their final years trying to destroy knowledge they regretted preserving.               |
| **52** | They recorded events so accurately that later Archivists use their work as the definitive source. |
| **53** | They went mad and wrote incomprehensible entries—or did they see something others could not?      |
| **54** | They achieved what they set out to preserve, but at a terrible personal cost.                     |
| **55** | They were revealed to be working for an enemy faction the entire time.                            |
| **56** | Their physical archive survived them by centuries, still legible and consulted.                   |
| **61** | They merged their consciousness with their archive through psychic means.                         |
| **62** | They trained a successor who revolutionized the entire practice of record-keeping.                |
| **63** | They were forgotten—only their work remains, attribution lost.                                    |
| **64** | They recorded knowledge that should never have been preserved.                                    |
| **65** | They became the subject of chronicles themselves, written by those who followed.                  |
| **66** | They were the last of their lineage—the tradition ended with them.                                |

## Playing with the End

When the **Ace of Spades** is drawn, the chronicle enters its final phase. Play continues for 1-3 more generations, then conclude with a **Final Entry**.

### Final Entry Format

> **1. State the Date & Final Archivist**
>
> **2. Reflect on the Lineage**  
> *What did the Archivists preserve? What was lost? How did their work shape Duskaran civilization?*
>
> **3. Address the Future**  
> *Will there be another Archivist? What remains to be recorded? What will those who come after inherit?*
>
> **4. The Archive's Fate**  
> *Is it preserved, destroyed, hidden, or transformed? Who will find it?*

### Example Final Entry

> **Archivist Helion Valeris, Cycle 9,200, The Age of Reckoning**
>
> Seven generations of my lineage have recorded the rise and fracture of Duskaran civilization. We watched settlements flourish and fall. We preserved knowledge that saved lives and truths that destroyed faith. We were keepers, not judges—but every choice to record or omit was judgment nonetheless.
>
> The great archives are fragmenting. Cave dwellers no longer recognize twilight authority. Settlements rewrite their own histories to justify isolation. What we built—a shared chronicle of our species on this world—may not survive another generation intact.
>
> I have trained no successor. Perhaps that is wisdom. Let the next age find its own voice, unburdened by our certainties and compromises. I leave this final entry not as ending, but as threshold.
>
> The archive remains. It will outlast us all. Whether it is found, understood, or believed—that is no longer ours to control.
>
> The wind remembers everything. Let it speak.
