# Introduction

**Duskara: Children of the Twilight** is a GMless tabletop RPG for 1+ players about building community in the twilight between worlds. You are settlers in a linear city stretched across Duskara's habitable band, descendants of a lost colony ship learning to thrive on a tidally locked world that was never meant to be home.

Eight centuries after landfall, your people have adapted—developing psychic abilities, mastering wind and thermal systems, forging bonds with native life. But adaptation is ongoing. Every cycle brings storms that test your infrastructure, questions about how to balance Earth traditions with Duskaran realities, and the choice between mere survival and building something worth passing forward.

This is planetary romance in the tradition of Le Guin—thoughtful, cultural, exploring what it means to become native to a place. Through cycles of nurturing (cradle) and protection (ward), you'll guide your community through challenges both practical and philosophical, creating a living story of people learning to belong to their world.

## Philosophy

You are the wind-shaped people, keepers of memory and makers of new traditions. Your settlement clings to the twilight belt, that narrow band where life can flourish between scorching day and frozen night. The eternal wind howls at your walls, storms gather where temperature extremes collide, and every drop of water is precious. Yet you have not just survived—you have adapted, evolved, created beauty in your communion with this world's fierce rhythms.

Through cycles of nurturing (cradle) and protection (ward), you face the questions that define any culture: How do we remember Earth while becoming children of Duskara? What technologies serve life, and which merely delay reckoning? How do we balance individual gifts—the thermal sensors, weather workers, bonded ones—with collective needs? Do we preserve the old ways, or embrace transformation?

This is not a game of apocalyptic survival. It is a story of people learning to live well in a place that demands everything and gives back strange gifts. Your settlement will grow, struggle, adapt, and transform. Whether it thrives or fractures depends on your choices—not heroics, but the daily work of building something worth continuing.

**The framework prioritizes:**

- **Harmony over conquest** (Duskara cannot be dominated, only understood)
- **Adaptation over preservation** (the old ways must evolve or ossify)
- **Community wisdom over individual power** (psychic gifts serve the whole)
- **Sustainability over exploitation** (every resource has limits)

# Setup

Before play, establish your settlement's foundation collaboratively (20-30 minutes). These choices shape everything that follows.

## Define Your Settlement

**What is the name of your settlement?**

Choose or create a name that reflects your community's character. Duskaran settlements often reference wind patterns, temperature zones, or founding ideals:

- Wind names: Galehold, Breezehaven, Stormwatch, Whisperkeep
- Temperature names: Warmhearth, Coolreach, Emberstone, Frostbreak
- Ideal names: Harmony Station, New Landing, Hope's Edge, Bridgepoint
- Hybrid names: Windharmony, Stormhearth, Emberbridge

**What kind of twilight belt settlement are you?**

Choose one that establishes your settlement's fundamental character:

- **Agricultural Hub** — Vertical farms and hydroponics; you feed surrounding settlements and pride yourselves on making things grow despite Duskara's harshness
- **Trading Crossroads** — Located where multiple Deep Road tunnels meet the surface; you're cosmopolitan, dealing with both twilight and cave dwellers
- **Research Outpost** — Founded by those seeking to understand Duskara's mysteries; you maintain ancient Earth equipment and study native phenomena
- **Refugee Gathering** — Recently formed by those displaced by catastrophic storms; diverse traditions clash and blend
- **Frontier Watch** — On the edge of the habitable zone; you push boundaries, test limits, venture where others won't
- **Elder City** — One of the first settlements; you carry deep memory but struggle with ossified traditions

**Where along the twilight belt?**

Your position affects daily life:

- **Night-ward edge** (cooler, calmer, closer to cave networks)
- **Mid-belt** (temperate, most stable, most crowded)
- **Day-ward edge** (warmer, harsher winds, closer to mining operations)

**What defines your settlement's culture?**

Choose 1-2 cultural touchstones:

- **Earth Rememberers** — You carefully preserve customs, languages, and traditions from the homeworld
- **Duskara-Born** — You embrace full adaptation, seeing yourselves as native to this world
- **Psychic Traditions** — Weather workers, thermal sensors, and bonded ones hold formal status and training
- **Techno-Preservationists** — You maintain and revere the old Earth technology
- **Wind Singers** — Your culture centers on music, poetry, and oral traditions shaped by the constant wind
- **Collective Governance** — Decisions made through consensus and careful deliberation
- **Guild Structure** — Specialized roles (weather workers, engineers, farmers) organized into formal guilds

## Time Scale: The Cycle System

Each turn represents **one cycle**—approximately 15-20 Duskaran days, or roughly one-third of Duskara's 30-35 day orbital period around HD Xanthea. Three turns equal one full orbital period.

A cycle is long enough for:

- Crops to show growth stages
- Major weather patterns to develop and pass
- Community projects to make visible progress
- Interpersonal dynamics to shift
- Resources to be depleted and replenished

This pacing balances immediate needs (food, water, storm preparation) with longer-term development (infrastructure, exploration, cultural evolution), matching the rhythm of life on Duskara where settlers must think in terms of the planetary cycle while responding to daily challenges.

## Initial Conditions

**Starting Resources** (choose 2-3)

What does your settlement have in abundance or reliable access to?

- **Wind Turbine Array** — Stable power generation from the eternal winds; lights stay on, systems run smoothly
- **Deep Aquifer Access** — Reliable underground water source; you're never thirsty, can afford irrigation
- **Vertical Farm Complex** — Multi-level agricultural system; food security and surplus for trade
- **Thermal Exchange Network** — Sophisticated heating/cooling using temperature differentials; comfortable living spaces
- **Storm Shelters** — Reinforced deep structures; your people weather superstorms safely
- **Data Crystal Archive** — Extensive preserved knowledge from Earth; technical and cultural information
- **Psychic Talent Pool** — Unusually high number of thermal sensors, weather workers, or bonded individuals
- **Deep Road Connection** — Direct tunnel access to cave settlements; regular trade and cultural exchange
- **Native Life Sanctuary** — Protected area where Duskaran creatures thrive; potential for bonding and study
- **Salvage Stockpile** — Recovered components from the *Stellar Horizon* or ancient mining equipment

**Starting Challenges** (choose 1-2)

What problems or tensions already exist?

- **Failing Infrastructure** — Critical systems (water pumps, power grid, storm barriers) showing age and wear
- **Resource Rationing** — One essential resource (water, food, power) insufficient for current population
- **Superstorm Damage** — Recent massive storm destroyed part of the settlement; rebuilding ongoing
- **Cultural Fracture** — Deep disagreement between Earth Rememberers and Duskara-Born about the community's direction
- **Psychic Unrest** — Gifted individuals (sensors, workers, bonded) feeling marginalized or exploited
- **Isolation** — Cut off from other settlements by broken Deep Roads or political tensions
- **Ancient Mystery** — Discovery of inexplicable structure or phenomenon nearby; some want to investigate, others fear it
- **Population Pressure** — Too many people for available resources; decisions about who can stay becoming urgent
- **Generational Divide** — Young and old unable to agree on settlement priorities
- **Boundary Dispute** — Conflict with neighboring settlement over territory, resources, or jurisdiction

**The First Question**

Pose one open question about your settlement's future to frame early play:

Sample questions:

- "Can we repair the failing thermal exchange before winter-side temperatures become unbearable?"
- "Will the Earth Rememberers and Duskara-Born find common ground, or will the settlement fracture?"
- "Should we investigate the ancient structure in the scorched lands, despite the dangers?"
- "How do we manage the growing population without exhausting our aquifer?"
- "Can the psychic talented be integrated as honored community members rather than feared outsiders?"
- "Will we reach out to the isolated cave settlements, or remain separate?"

## Choose Tracking Method

Select how you'll record your settlement's evolution:

1. **Map** — Draw the linear city stretched along the twilight belt; add structures, farms, wind turbines
2. **Timeline** — Chronicle the settlement's story cycle by cycle with dates and events
3. **Character Web** — Focus on emerging individuals and their relationships
4. **Combined Approach** — Use multiple methods as needed

Record this somewhere all players can see and modify.

## Materials Needed

- Standard 52-card playing deck
- Paper and writing implements
- 4-6 six-sided dice (d6)

# Turn Structure

Each turn follows this sequence. Don't skip steps—each serves a purpose.

## 1. Draw

The active player draws one card from the deck and places it face-up. This is the **Prompt Card**.

**If the deck runs out:** Reshuffle all non-milestone cards (2-10) and continue. Queens and Kings stay in the discard—they've already triggered their phase transitions.

## 2. Interpret

The table discusses what the prompt means for your settlement **right now**, given your current situation, challenges, and recent events.

The card provides the raw prompt through its suit and rank. The table brings it to life by grounding it in your settlement's specific circumstances.

**Suit determines the domain:**

- **Hearts** (♥) — Community & Culture: bonds, traditions, celebrations, conflicts, memory
- **Diamonds** (♦) — Resources & Technology: water, power, food, infrastructure, Earth-tech
- **Spades** (♠) — Environment & Adaptation: wind, storms, native life, psychic abilities, Duskara's beauty and harshness
- **Clubs** (♣) — Mysteries & Change: ancient structures, lost knowledge, transformation, the unknown

**Rank determines intensity and type:**

**2-5: Everyday Realities** — Normal challenges and opportunities

- 2: Minor obstacle or need requiring attention
- 3: Small opportunity or positive development
- 4: Modest challenge with clear stakes
- 5: Noticeable shift or emerging situation

**6-9: Significant Developments** — Substantial situations demanding decisions

- 6: Important opportunity that could improve things
- 7: Serious challenge testing the community
- 8: Major development requiring immediate action
- 9: Complex situation with competing interests

**10: Critical Event** — Urgent, high-stakes situations

- The settlement faces a crucial moment
- Multiple people or systems affected
- Success or failure will have lasting consequences

**Face Cards (J, Q, K, A): Special Functions**

**Jack: Wild Card** — Table chooses any suit interpretation

- Useful for addressing neglected areas
- Can combine elements from multiple suits
- Opportunity to spotlight overlooked aspects

**Queen: Milestone (Growth Phase)** — See Phases section

**King: Milestone (Crisis Phase)** — See Phases section

**Ace: Character Emerges** — See Characters section

**The First Queen and King of each suit trigger phase transitions the first time they appear.**

**Example Interpretations:**

*3 of Spades (Environment & Adaptation, small opportunity):* "A weather worker senses a pattern in the wind that could improve turbine efficiency for the next cycle."

*7 of Hearts (Community & Culture, serious challenge):* "Tensions between Earth Rememberers and Duskara-Born erupt during a cultural ceremony; both sides demand the settlement choose a direction."

*10 of Diamonds (Resources & Technology, critical event):* "The aquifer shows alarming signs of depletion. Emergency measures needed immediately or rationing becomes permanent."

*Jack (Wild Card):* "We haven't dealt with any mysteries lately. Let's make this about the strange lights some scouts reported seeing in the scorched lands at dawn."

## 3. Choose Action

After interpreting the prompt, the table discusses which of the four actions fits best. Sometimes it's obvious; sometimes there's debate. That discussion is valuable—it reveals what the community prioritizes.

**The Four Actions:**

**CRADLE** — Nurture resources, knowledge, culture, or infrastructure

- Plant crops, repair equipment, preserve traditions, teach skills
- Building for the future; sustainability over quick gains
- Proactive care and maintenance

**WARD** — Defend against immediate threats or dangers

- Fight storms, repel hazards, protect people, secure resources
- Reactive response to danger
- Prevention and protection

**PROJECT** — Undertake major initiatives requiring time and coordination

- Multi-phase endeavors: new infrastructure, expeditions, cultural reforms
- Can't be completed in one turn
- See Projects section for details

**DELIBERATE** — Discuss, decide, and set community direction

- Resolve open questions, make policy, address internal conflicts
- Pure social/philosophical work
- Changes community values or priorities

**Choosing Guidelines:**

The prompt suggests a natural action, but the table can choose differently based on community needs:

- If the prompt presents danger → often Ward
- If it offers opportunity for growth → often Cradle or Project
- If it creates internal tension → often Deliberate
- When in doubt, discuss what the community needs most right now

**Example:**

*Prompt: 7 of Hearts - "Tensions erupt during a ceremony; both factions demand the settlement choose a direction."*

Possible responses:

- **Cradle:** Host a series of small gatherings to build understanding before the division worsens
- **Ward:** Intervene immediately to prevent the conflict from escalating to violence
- **Project:** Begin a formal cultural exchange program to bridge the divide
- **Deliberate:** Call a settlement-wide council to hash out core values and direction

Each approach is valid; the choice reflects the settlement's character and current priorities.

## 4. Resolve Action

**Resolution uses a simple dice pool system:**

**Base Pool:** Roll 1d6

**Add dice for advantages** (max 4d6 total):

- **Relevant character:** +1d6 if a character with applicable tags is involved
- **Relevant resource:** +1d6 if you have a resource that directly helps
- **Favorable conditions:** +1d6 if circumstances support the action
- **Cooperation:** +1d6 if multiple characters/groups work together

**Success Threshold:** 4+ on any die = success

**Count successes** (how many dice show 4+):

- **0 successes:** Failure with consequences
- **1 success:** Partial success with complications
- **2 successes:** Success with minor cost
- **3+ successes:** Overwhelming success

**Psychic Ability Integration:**

Characters with psychic tags grant +1d6 in relevant situations:

- **Thermal Sensor:** Detecting danger from temperature changes, navigating hot/cold extremes, finding heat sources
- **Weather Worker:** Predicting storms, calming winds, improving agricultural yields, protecting during superstorms
- **Bonded (specific creature):** Tasks involving that creature type, understanding native ecology, traveling terrain

These abilities emerged from Duskaran radiation and environmental pressures. They're natural tools for living well here, not supernatural powers.

**Example Resolution:**

*Action: Cradle — Host gatherings to build understanding between factions* *Base: 1d6* *+1d6: Mara, a respected Elder (Mediator tag)* *+1d6: Community Hall (relevant resource)* *+1d6: Recent shared triumph during storm (favorable conditions)* *Total: 4d6*

*Roll: 5, 4, 3, 2 = 2 successes* *Result: Success with minor cost. The gatherings build bridges, but some hardliners on both sides feel betrayed and withdraw from community life. Progress, but not perfect.*

## 5. Update Community

**Record the outcome:**

- Modify your tracking (map, timeline, character web)
- Add/remove resources as appropriate
- Update Open Questions
- Note character development
- **Adjust Tension** (see Tension section)

**This step is crucial.** The game creates a living history through accumulated updates. Don't skip documentation.

## 6. Pass

The next player becomes active and draws a new card. Play continues clockwise (or any agreed order for async/solo play).

# Actions in Detail

## CRADLE — Nurture and Build

Cradle actions invest in the settlement's future: growing food, repairing infrastructure, teaching skills, preserving culture, building relationships. These are proactive, generative actions that create capacity and sustainability.

**Duskara-Specific Cradle Examples:**

**Agricultural & Resource:**

- Expand vertical farms with new growth tiers
- Develop drought-resistant crop varieties from Earth seeds

**Cradle Success Outcomes:**

- **Failure:** Resources wasted, knowledge lost, opportunity missed; **+1 Tension**
- **Partial:** Some progress but complications or unexpected costs
- **Success:** Solid foundation built with minor limitations
- **Overwhelming:** Major advancement, surplus generated, new opportunities created; **-1 Tension** possible

## WARD — Defend and Protect

Ward actions respond to immediate threats: storms, equipment failures, conflicts, external dangers. These are reactive, protective actions ensuring the settlement survives to continue building.

**Duskara-Specific Ward Examples:**

**Environmental Hazards:**

- Prepare for incoming superstorm predicted by weather workers
- Respond to sudden temperature spikes threatening greenhouses
- Rescue people caught in flash wind-shear
- Contain fire from overheated thermal exchangers
- Evacuate areas threatened by day-side heat creep

**Infrastructure Crises:**

- Emergency repair of failing storm barriers mid-storm
- Prevent aquifer contamination from surface breach
- Restore power during critical system outage
- Stabilize collapsing sections of linear city structure
- Fight equipment fires in cramped quarters

**Social Threats:**

- Prevent violent conflict between feuding factions
- Stop hoarding of critical resources during scarcity
- Intervene when someone's psychic abilities spiral out of control
- Mediate before a splinter group causes permanent fracture
- Protect vulnerable individuals from mob mentality

**External Dangers:**

- Defend against predatory native creatures
- Secure settlement from raiders or desperate refugees
- Retrieve people lost in the scorched lands
- Warn neighboring settlements of cascading hazards
- Protect salvage operations from claim-jumpers

**Ward Success Outcomes:**

- **Failure:** Loss, damage, injury, the threat succeeds; **+1 Tension** (potentially +2 for catastrophic failures)
- **Partial:** Threat contained but at significant cost
- **Success:** Danger averted with minor losses
- **Overwhelming:** Threat eliminated completely, lessons learned, community strengthened; **-1 Tension**

## PROJECT — Major Initiatives

Projects are substantial undertakings requiring multiple cycles and coordination. They represent the settlement's ambitious plans for growth, exploration, or transformation.

**Starting a Project:**

When the table agrees to begin a Project, define:

1. **Goal:** What are you trying to achieve?
2. **Scope:** How many progress segments needed (typically 3-5)
3. **Requirements:** What resources or conditions necessary
4. **Stakes:** What happens if it fails or succeeds

Mark a **Project Track** with segments. Each successful Cradle action toward the Project fills one segment. When all segments are filled, the Project completes.

**During each cycle with an active Project:**

- The prompt may relate to the Project or not
- You can choose to advance the Project (counts as Cradle) or address the prompt differently
- Failed Cradle rolls don't erase progress but may add complications
- Projects can be abandoned, but invested resources are lost

**Duskara-Specific Project Examples:**

**Infrastructure Projects (3-4 segments):**

- **New Settlement Wing** — Expand the linear city into newly temperate territory
- **Deep Road Extension** — Tunnel connection to neighboring settlement or cave network
- **Storm Research Station** — Observatory platform to study and predict superstorms
- **Geothermal Tap** — Drill deep to access additional heat/power from night-side vents
- **Orbital Beacon** — Restore and upgrade ancient satellites for communication

**Exploration Projects (4-5 segments):**

- **Scorched Lands Expedition** — Mount properly equipped journey into the day-side margins
- **Cave System Mapping** — Chart and secure the deeper tunnel networks
- **Ancient Structure Investigation** — Study mysterious pre-human ruins
- **Native Life Preserve** — Establish protected zones for Duskaran ecology study
- **Horizon Search** — Seek other potential settlement sites along the belt

**Cultural Projects (3-4 segments):**

- **Cultural Synthesis Festival** — Year-long series of events blending Earth and Duskaran traditions
- **Psychic Academy** — Formal institution for training and supporting gifted individuals
- **Oral History Archive** — Systematic recording of elder memories and stories
- **Inter-Settlement Exchange** — Regular visiting program between communities
- **New Governance Structure** — Redesign how collective decisions are made

**Technological Projects (4-5 segments):**

- **Atmospheric Processor** — Develop system to improve local air quality
- **Genetic Archive Lab** — Facilities to preserve and study biological diversity
- **Sustainable Synthesis** — Create closed-loop recycling for critical materials
- **Enhanced Thermal Suits** — Develop equipment for longer day-side expeditions
- **Data Crystal Restoration** — Recover lost technical information from damaged archives

**Project Completion:** When all segments are filled, describe the Project's success and its impacts. Completed Projects often:

- Remove or mitigate a Challenge
- Create a new Resource
- Answer Open Questions
- Generate new opportunities
- **Reduce Tension by 2**

**Project Failure:** Projects can be abandoned if circumstances change or the settlement decides to prioritize differently. This isn't necessarily bad—it reflects shifting needs. But invested resources are lost, and abandoned Projects may leave complications.

## DELIBERATE — Discuss and Decide

Deliberate actions focus on collective decision-making, resolving internal tensions, and defining community values. These are purely social and philosophical—you're not building or defending, you're deciding **who you are** as a people.

**When to Deliberate:**

- Open Questions need resolution
- Serious disagreements threaten community cohesion
- Major policy decisions required
- Cultural direction must be chosen
- Ethical dilemmas have no clear answer

**Deliberate Mechanics:**

Unlike other actions, Deliberate **doesn't use dice**. Instead, the table engages in actual discussion and roleplays the community's decision-making process.

**The Process:**

1. **Frame the question:** What exactly are we deciding?
2. **Voice perspectives:** Players speak for different viewpoints (not necessarily their own)
3. **Seek common ground:** What can everyone accept?
4. **Make a decision:** Consensus, vote, elder ruling, or other method appropriate to your culture
5. **Record the outcome:** Document the decision and its implications

**Important:** The settlement's decision doesn't need to be unanimous among players—that's often unrealistic. But the **choice to use Deliberate should be unanimous** among players. If the table agrees this issue demands community attention, then you Deliberate. The in-setting outcome can reflect disagreement, compromise, or even bitter splits.

**Duskara-Specific Deliberate Examples:**

**Cultural Identity Questions:**

- Should we continue teaching Earth languages, or let them fade naturally?
- Do psychic talented deserve special status, equal status, or should abilities be downplayed?
- Are we exiles longing for Earth, or natives of Duskara now?
- How much should we preserve exact Earth customs versus adapting them?

**Resource Ethics:**

- Who gets priority for scarce water during severe rationing?
- Can we ethically mine the scorched lands for resources we need?
- Should we accept refugees if it strains our carrying capacity?
- How do we handle individuals who consume more than their share?

**Governance Questions:**

- Should decisions be made by consensus, elected council, guild representatives, or elders?
- How do we balance individual freedom with collective needs?
- What crimes warrant exile from the settlement?
- Should we align with specific neighboring settlements or remain neutral?

**Adaptation Dilemmas:**

- Is it acceptable to genetically modify crops, animals, or humans for Duskaran conditions?
- Should we bond with native creatures, or is that exploitation?
- Do we study ancient alien structures, or leave them alone out of respect or fear?
- How much risk is acceptable in pursuit of growth?

**Deliberate Outcomes:**

**Consensus Reached:**

- The settlement has clear direction
- Internal tension reduces; **-1 Tension**
- Decision becomes part of community identity
- May open new possibilities or close others

**Compromise Achieved:**

- Partial agreement satisfying most
- Middle ground found but some remain unhappy
- Tension stays stable
- Often creates new Open Questions

**Fracture Occurs:**

- No agreement possible
- **+1 Tension** as the split deepens
- Community may divide into factions
- This is valid drama—not a "failure"

**Example Deliberate:**

*Open Question: "Are psychic talented honored community assets or dangerous anomalies?"*

*The table discusses:*

- Elder Mara argues they're precious adaptations to Duskara
- Young engineer Tomas fears uncontrolled abilities could cause disasters
- Weather worker Keris resents being treated as a tool
- Thermal sensor Daylen just wants to help without being othered

*Outcome: The settlement establishes a Psychic Academy offering training and community, but also regulation and ethics guidelines. Mostly consensus, with lingering discomfort from both extremes. Tension stays stable, but a new resource (trained, integrated psychics) is gained.*

# Characters

Characters emerge naturally from play rather than being created at the start. As the settlement faces challenges and opportunities, individuals step forward, take action, leave marks.

**When Characters Emerge:**

**Aces:** When an Ace is drawn, a significant individual emerges or an existing character gains prominence.

The table describes:

- **Name:** Use Duskaran naming conventions or create your own
- **Role:** What function do they serve? (farmer, engineer, weather worker, mediator, etc.)
- **Distinctive trait:** One memorable characteristic
- **Initial tags:** Choose 1-2 from the Tag list

**Organic Emergence:** Characters can also emerge naturally when the fiction demands it. If a resolution requires someone to take the lead, name them. If a project needs a champion, create one. Let characters appear when the story calls for them.

**Character Tags:**

Tags grant +1d6 when relevant to the action. Choose tags that reflect role, abilities, or personality:

**Professional Roles:**

- **Farmer:** Hydroponic expert, crop geneticist
- **Engineer:** Maintains wind turbines, thermal systems, infrastructure
- **Mediator:** Skilled at conflict resolution and building consensus
- **Scholar:** Preserves knowledge, teaches, researches
- **Scout:** Explores dangerous terrain, navigates unfamiliar areas
- **Healer:** Medical training, emergency response, caregiving
- **Artisan:** Creates functional and beautiful objects
- **Salvager:** Recovers and repurposes old technology

**Psychic Abilities:**

- **Thermal Sensor:** Perceives heat signatures and temperature shifts
- **Weather Worker:** Predicts and gently influences wind and storm patterns
- **Bonded (specify creature):** Psychic connection with a specific Duskaran life form
- **Deep Listener:** Senses emotional currents in groups
- **Memory Keeper:** Exceptional recall of oral histories and technical details

**Cultural Roles:**

- **Earth Rememberer:** Devoted to preserving homeworld traditions
- **Duskara-Born:** Embraces full adaptation to this world
- **Bridge Builder:** Connects disparate groups and perspectives
- **Storyteller:** Preserves and creates narratives; wind-singer
- **Tradition Keeper:** Maintains ceremonies and cultural practices

**Personal Traits:**

- **Cautious:** Thoughtful, risk-averse, detail-oriented
- **Bold:** Takes chances, pushes boundaries, leads from the front
- **Compassionate:** Deeply cares for others' wellbeing
- **Pragmatic:** Focuses on practical solutions over ideals
- **Visionary:** Sees possibilities others miss
- **Stubborn:** Holds firm to principles and positions
- **Adaptable:** Flexible, quick to adjust to new circumstances

**Character Development:**

Characters grow through play:

- **Add tags** when they learn new skills or embrace new roles
- **Remove tags** if they fundamentally change or abandon old ways
- **Highlight moments** that define or transform them
- **Track relationships** between characters as they emerge

Characters can die, leave, or retire. This is natural. Their influence persists in the settlement's memory and the ripples they created.

**Character Limits:**

Most games organically develop 4-8 significant characters. Too many dilutes focus; too few limits perspective. If you have more than 10 named characters, consider consolidating or letting some fade into the background.

# Phases

The game unfolds in four phases, each with distinct tone and mechanical emphasis. Phase transitions occur when specific milestone cards (Queens and Kings) appear.

**Important:** The first Queen and King of each suit trigger phase transitions. After that, subsequent Queens and Kings of the same suit no longer trigger transitions—they function as the prompt indicates.

## Phase 1: Establishment

**Duration:** Until the first Queen of any suit is drawn

**Tone:** Hopeful, ambitious, foundational

**Focus:** The settlement is finding its footing. Players define community identity, establish resources, set up infrastructure, and articulate initial aspirations. Challenges exist but feel manageable. The future seems open.

**Mechanical Notes:**

- Characters emerge slowly; typically 2-4 by phase end
- Tension starts low and builds gradually
- Projects initiated tend to be infrastructural
- Deliberate actions often define cultural identity

**Phase Ends:** When any Queen appears, read that suit's Growth Phase entry below, then transition to Phase 2.

## Phase 2: Growth

**Duration:** From first Queen until first King

**Tone:** Expansive, confident, ambitious

**Focus:** The settlement thrives. Projects advance, population grows, relationships with neighbors develop. There's momentum and optimism, but also growing complexity. Success brings new challenges—managing abundance, dealing with growth pains, exploring beyond safe boundaries.

**Mechanical Notes:**

- More characters emerge; settlement feels populated
- Projects become more ambitious
- Challenges test systems but feel surmountable
- External relationships (other settlements, exploration) become prominent

**Queen Effects (when first drawn):**

- **Queen of Hearts** — A celebration or cultural triumph; community bonds strengthen
- **Queen of Diamonds** — Resource abundance or technological breakthrough; new capacity unlocked
- **Queen of Spades** — Deeper understanding of Duskara emerges; adaptation accelerates
- **Queen of Clubs** — A mystery revealed or transformation embraced; the settlement evolves

**Phase Ends:** When any King appears, read that suit's Crisis Phase entry below, then transition to Phase 3.

## Phase 3: Crisis

**Duration:** From first King until Resolution deck exhausts (or alternate end conditions)

**Tone:** Tested, strained, consequential

**Focus:** The settlement faces existential challenges. Growth has created vulnerabilities; success has attracted attention or exhausted reserves. Core questions about identity, sustainability, and survival demand answers. Not all challenges can be solved—some require difficult choices and sacrifice.

**Mechanical Notes:**

- Tension rises faster
- Characters face hard decisions
- Projects may fail or succeed at great cost
- Deliberate actions tackle fundamental dilemmas
- The settlement's long-term viability is genuinely uncertain

**King Effects (when first drawn):**

- **King of Hearts** — Community fractures or someone important leaves; internal crisis
- **King of Diamonds** — Critical resource failure or technological breakdown; infrastructure crisis
- **King of Spades** — Environmental catastrophe or dangerous native phenomenon; Duskara strikes back
- **King of Clubs** — A terrible truth revealed or irreversible change occurs; transformation crisis

**Design Note on Crisis:** This isn't about punishing the players. It's about creating stakes that matter. The settlement may emerge stronger, transformed, or fractured—all are valid outcomes. The key is that choices during Crisis define who the community becomes.

**Phase Ends:** When the Resolution deck exhausts, or the settlement collapses (15 Tension), or the table unanimously agrees the story is complete.

## Phase 4: Resolution

**Duration:** Final few cards of the deck (typically last 3-5 turns)

**Tone:** Reflective, conclusive, weighted with accumulated history

**Focus:** The settlement's fate crystallizes. Earlier choices bear fruit or haunt decisions. Questions receive answers, though not always the ones hoped for. The community's character—what it built, what it sacrificed, what it became—is revealed through how it handles these final challenges.

**Mechanical Notes:**

- Final actions carry extra weight
- Unresolved questions demand attention
- Characters make defining choices
- The settlement's ultimate fate becomes clear

**This phase often happens naturally** as the deck runs low, so it doesn't require a separate trigger. Players feel it: the story is concluding. Lean into it. Make final turns meaningful.

# Tension

Tension tracks accumulating stress, unresolved problems, and strain on community cohesion. It rises when things go poorly and falls when the settlement manages major successes.

**Starting Tension:** 0

**Tension Increases (+1 unless noted):**

- Cradle fails
- Ward fails
- Project abandoned
- Deliberate ends in fracture
- Critical resources depleted
- Characters die or leave bitterly
- Environmental catastrophes
- Serious inter-personal conflicts

**Tension Decreases (-1 unless noted):**

- Ward overwhelming success (3+): -1
- Project completion: -2
- Deliberate reaches genuine consensus: -1
- Major celebration or cultural triumph: -1

**Tension Thresholds:**

**0-2 Tension — Stable:**

- Normal operations
- Challenges feel manageable
- Community cohesion strong

**3-4 Tension — Strained:**

- Noticeable stress
- People short-tempered, tired
- Systems running near capacity

**5 Tension — Minor Crisis:**

- Something breaks: infrastructure fails, key person collapses, factional split erupts
- Draw an additional card immediately and interpret as a complication
- Must be addressed before play can continue normally

**6-9 Tension — Dangerous:**

- Multiple problems cascade
- Community morale low
- Collapse feels possible

**10 Tension — Major Crisis:**

- Existential threat to settlement
- Draw an additional card immediately and interpret as worst-case scenario
- Must be addressed with full community effort before normal play resumes

**15 Tension — Collapse:**

- Settlement fractures, fails, or dissolves
- Game ends immediately
- Proceed to Final Reflection on what caused the fall

**Design Philosophy:** Tension creates pressure to address problems actively rather than ignoring them. It's not a countdown to inevitable doom—settlements can stabilize and reduce Tension through good decisions. But it ensures consequences accumulate if problems are neglected.

# Prompt Cards: Suits Detailed

These descriptions help interpret what each suit represents in Duskara's context. Use them to ground prompts in the setting's specific elements.

## Hearts (♥) — Community & Culture

Hearts represent the human element: relationships, traditions, celebrations, conflicts, memory. This is the internal social life of the settlement—how people connect, clash, remember, and create meaning together.

**Typical prompts involve:**

- Interpersonal relationships (friendships, romances, rivalries, family)
- Cultural practices (festivals, ceremonies, wind-songs, storytelling)
- Memory and history (Earth traditions, elder stories, preserved customs)
- Community gatherings (celebrations, councils, shared meals)
- Internal tensions (factional disagreements, generational gaps, value conflicts)
- Education and transmission (teaching children, passing knowledge, mentorship)
- Identity questions (who are we? what do we preserve? how do we change?)

**Example prompts:**

- 2♥: A child asks an elder to teach them an Earth language
- 5♥: Two factions disagree over how to celebrate an upcoming festival
- 8♥: A beloved community member considers leaving for another settlement
- 10♥: A marriage ceremony between Earth Rememberer and Duskara-Born becomes flashpoint for wider tensions

## Diamonds (♦) — Resources & Technology

Diamonds represent the material and technical aspects of survival: water, power, food, infrastructure, maintained technology. This is the practical side of life on Duskara—the systems that keep people alive and thriving.

**Typical prompts involve:**

- Water systems (aquifers, atmospheric collectors, purification, distribution)
- Energy (wind turbines, thermal exchangers, power grids, battery storage)
- Food production (vertical farms, hydroponics, crop genetics, native cultivation)
- Infrastructure (storm barriers, thermal insulation, structural integrity, expansion)
- Technology maintenance (repairing old equipment, salvaging components, preserving knowledge)
- Resource scarcity (rationing, allocation, conservation, depletion warnings)
- Material abundance (surplus, trade opportunities, technological breakthroughs)

**Example prompts:**

- 3♦: Atmospheric moisture collectors yield a small surplus for the first time
- 6♦: Engineers develop a more efficient wind turbine blade design
- 9♦: The aquifer shows concerning signs of mineral contamination
- 10♦: Main power grid fails during a critical moment

## Spades (♠) — Environment & Adaptation

Spades represent Duskara itself: the wind, storms, temperature extremes, native life, and the psychic abilities humans developed to survive here. This is the interface between humanity and the planet—both the challenges and the gifts of adaptation.

**Typical prompts involve:**

- Weather phenomena (superstorms, wind shifts, temperature spikes, aurora displays)
- Native life (creatures, plants, ecosystems, bonding opportunities, ecological mysteries)
- Psychic abilities (new manifestations, training, control issues, ethical questions)
- Environmental hazards (heat creep from day-side, cold snaps, air quality, radiation)
- Duskara's beauty (twilight vistas, wind harmonics, bioluminescent displays, adaptation successes)
- Physical adaptation (genetic changes, environmental tolerance, evolutionary pressure)
- Harmony vs. struggle (learning to flow with Duskara vs. fighting it)

**Example prompts:**

- 4♠: A young thermal sensor's abilities manifest unexpectedly
- 7♠: Weather workers detect an unprecedented storm pattern forming
- 8♠: Native creatures usually docile become agitated and dangerous
- 10♠: The twilight belt's temperature bands shift suddenly; the settlement is now too warm

## Clubs (♣) — Mysteries & Change

Clubs represent the unknown, transformation, and deep questions: ancient structures, lost knowledge, philosophical dilemmas, internal evolution. This is about the settlement grappling with what it doesn't understand and who it's becoming.

**Typical prompts involve:**

- Ancient mysteries (pre-human structures, unexplained phenomena, alien artifacts)
- Lost knowledge (recovering *Stellar Horizon* data, fragmented Earth history, forgotten technologies)
- Exploration discoveries (new territories, hidden caves, strange readings, uncharted areas)
- Internal transformation (fundamental cultural shifts, generational changes, identity evolution)
- Philosophical questions (purpose, meaning, ethics of adaptation, relationship to Duskara)
- Unexpected changes (mutations, new abilities, spontaneous cultural innovations)
- Secrets revealed (hidden histories, concealed truths, unspoken knowledge)

**Example prompts:**

- 3♣: Scouts find geometric patterns in rock formations that might be artificial
- 6♣: Old data crystals reveal the *Stellar Horizon*'s crew knew the destination was wrong
- 9♣: A group of young people spontaneously develop a new form of psychic connection
- 10♣: The settlement discovers they're not the only descendants of the lost ship

| K    | **Crisis Phase Milestone** (first time) / Terrible knowledge or irreversible change shatters old certainties (subsequent)          |

**Using These Prompts:**

These prompts are designed to work for most twilight belt settlements, but you should always interpret them through your specific context:

- What has happened recently in your settlement?
- What challenges and resources do you currently have?
- What questions are already open?
- What characters exist and what do they care about?

**Example:** The prompt "A child asks to learn something from the old world" (2♥) plays very differently in:

- An Earth Rememberer settlement (honored, immediate teaching)
- A Duskara-Born settlement (awkward, maybe refused)
- A fractured settlement (becomes a factional issue)

**Creating Your Own Prompts:**

Once familiar with the game, create custom prompts by:

1. Choose a suit (Hearts/Diamonds/Spades/Clubs)
2. Match the rank's intensity (2-5 everyday, 6-9 significant, 10 critical)
3. Ground it in your settlement's specific situation
4. Leave room for interpretation

Custom prompts often emerge naturally from play: "That situation would make a perfect 7 of Hearts for next time..."

# End Conditions

The game concludes when one of three conditions is met:

**Primary End: Deck Exhausts** All 23 cards in the Resolution deck are drawn (52 minus 4 Aces, minus Queens/Kings that triggered transitions, minus any removed cards). This is the natural conclusion after a full story arc and the most common ending.

**Alternative End: Story Complete** The table unanimously agrees the narrative has reached a satisfying conclusion before the deck exhausts. This requires consensus and should only happen when key questions are answered and the settlement's fate feels clear.

**Early End: Collapse** Tension reaches 15 and the settlement fractures, fails, or dissolves. This is a valid and meaningful ending—not a "loss." Communities sometimes cannot hold together under strain. It's honest to the premise.

## Final Reflection

After the game ends, spend 20-30 minutes in reflection using these prompts. This is essential for closure and sense-making.

**Core Questions:**

- What did the settlement build that will endure?
- What was lost along the way? What sacrifices were made?
- Which characters were most important? Where are they now?
- Which choices defined the settlement's ultimate fate?
- Did you find harmony with Duskara, or remain in tension with it?
- Are you still descendants of Earth, or something new?

**Duskara-Specific Questions:**

- How many cycles did your settlement endure?
- What became of the relationship between Earth Rememberers and Duskara-Born?
- Did psychic abilities become honored gifts or feared powers?
- What traditions from Earth survived? Which ones adapted beyond recognition?
- How did you manage the wind, the storms, the water?
- Did you explore the mysteries, or leave them alone?
- Would the *Stellar Horizon*'s original crew recognize what you became?
- What wind-songs will future generations sing about your time?

**Document the Ending:**

- Photograph or scan your final tracking state
- Write a closing entry describing the settlement's ultimate fate
- Each player narrates a brief epilogue from one character's perspective
- Consider: what comes next for this place and these people?

**Endings Can Be:**

- **Triumphant:** The settlement thrives, having overcome all challenges
- **Bittersweet:** Success came at great cost; something precious was sacrificed
- **Transformed:** The settlement survived by becoming something unexpected
- **Fractured:** The community split, but both groups continue in their own ways
- **Collapsed:** The settlement failed, but individuals escaped to tell the story
- **Ambiguous:** The outcome is uncertain; perhaps another game continues the tale

All endings are valid. What matters is that they feel earned—that they emerged from the choices made, the dice rolled, and the story told together.
