# Duskara

***Duskara*** is a tabletop role-playing game for two or more players that focuses on essential and intuitive rules, enriched by clear examples and insights into the philosophy that inspires its mechanics.

This game is based on *Ensemble*, an evolution of *Freeform Universal (FU)* by Nathan Russell, a revolutionary RPG that, despite not receiving the attention it deserved, has inspired many players. *Duskara* reworks and expands on its concepts, staying true to the spirit of minimalism and flexibility of FU, but explaining its nuances.

Duskara is based on the general principle that ***fiction precedes mechanics*** (we'll explore this further later), so what matters is immersing yourself in your character in a fictional situation, thinking about what they would do, and verifying if their actions can succeed. From the game world's reaction, ***an emergent, non-predetermined narrative will naturally arise***, which you will discover along with the other players.

## Introduction

### What is role-playing?

Role-playing is like stepping into a book or a movie, where you and your friends are the protagonists. Together, by talking, listening, and taking cues from each other, you build an imaginary world where extraordinary adventures take place. This world is held together by a few rules that help decide what happens when the characters (that's you!) make decisions or face challenges. As the game progresses, your intertwined actions create an exciting and unpredictable story, a kind of epic tale that develops naturally from beginning to end.

Here are the elements that bring this experience to life:

- **A shared imaginary world:** It's like when you were kids and said, "let's pretend that..." and then imagined being in a castle or in space. Except here, everyone agrees on this "let's pretend that" and you build this imaginary world together. We call this the ***imagined space***.
  
- **Chat and collaborate:**
  During the game, you will talk among yourselves, listening to each other and building the story together. It's a bit like improvising in a "theater of the mind" where each player contributes their own ideas. We call this ***dialogue, listening, and reincorporation***.
  
- **Players:** Anyone who participates in the adventure. There might also be one person who acts as a guide, called the "Game Master," but ultimately, they are a player just like the others, only with a special task.
  
- **Procedures:** These are the guidelines that help everyone understand how to proceed together. For example, a procedure might be how you decide who tells the next part of the story, or how to introduce a new character or challenge into the adventure. These procedures ensure the game experience is smooth and that everyone has a chance to contribute to the game.
  
- **Rules:** Imagine a set of rules that help decide what happens when characters try something daring, like navigating a superstorm or channeling the wind's power. This system guides the game and makes things more exciting.
  
- **Actions and events:** In the imaginary world, the characters (played by you) will live adventures, facing challenges, solving puzzles, or confronting hostile forces. Your decisions will lead to new developments and surprises.
  
- **A story created together:** As you play, your actions and decisions intertwine into a unique and unpredictable story. In the end, you will have created together a tale of adventures, heroism, perhaps even betrayals and discovered mysteries, which you will remember as your epic adventure. This is called an ***emergent shared narrative***.

In simple terms, role-playing is when you and your friends get together to create stories together, living incredible adventures without moving from the table (or wherever you prefer to play).

### Game Principles

*Duskara* is built on the following game principles:

- **Fiction precedes mechanics:** Before thinking about checking stats or rolling dice, let yourself be carried away by the story and the environment you are creating together. The characters' adventurous decisions and the world's responses bring the game to life. The dice only come into play when things become uncertain or dangerous, and it's our stories that call them into action, not the other way around.

- **The setting is an invisible ruleset:** The world where your adventures take place silently guides the game, suggesting and limiting actions based on its unique characteristics. The twilight belt's eternal wind, the day side's killing heat, the night side's frozen depths—these shape what's possible as much as any written rule. In a world where psychic abilities manifest through environmental adaptation, reaching out to sense thermal patterns becomes natural, just as understanding wind currents does.

- **Play honestly:** Building a game on trust means that players collaborate without hindrance. There's no need to cheat or check every move because you trust each other. This trust encourages bold ideas and creative contributions, making the story a true team effort.

- **In the imagined world, any attempt is allowed:** Remember that in the game, you can attempt any action you imagine, as long as you respect the rules of the setting. The rules help us shape our adventures but should never limit our creativity. The dice help resolve uncertainties, enriching the game with unexpected elements.

- **The game is a dialogue:** Talking and listening are at the heart of role-playing. The continuous conversation not only moves the story forward but also helps explore the characters and the world. It is through this dialogue that adventures come to life and become real for the players.

- **Listening and reincorporation are the main mechanics:** Listening to what others say and building on it is fundamental. It's not just about hearing, but about understanding and integrating everyone's ideas into the story, making the game richer and more engaging.

- **Rules abstract:** The rules transform the complexities of the imaginary world into something manageable and playable, allowing us to immerse ourselves deeper in the adventure. They serve to create a common language for action and conflict resolution, letting players focus on the story rather than technical details.

- **Play to find out:** Venture into the game world without fixed expectations, letting discoveries and unexpected events guide the adventure. This approach values surprise and exploration, leading to rich and unpredictable stories.

- **Let the story emerge:** Instead of following a fixed script, let the story develop through player choices and random events. This process makes every game unique and the narrative directly influenced by those participating, creating a genuinely shared and always-new experience.

### Game Materials

Playing *Duskara* requires minimal materials that promote easy immersion in the narrative and interaction between players. Here is the list of what you need to get started:

- **Six-sided dice:** You will need a handful of these dice, ideally in three different colors. One color will be used for the Action Die, which determines the outcome of the characters' actions. The other two colors will be for the Chance Dice and Risk Dice, which introduce positive and negative elements to the roll. Ideally, each player should have a set containing at least one Action Die, six Chance Dice, and six Risk Dice.
- **Character sheet:** Essential for recording the character's specifics, skills, and gear, as well as the progress made in the adventure.
- **Writing materials:** Pens, pencils, and paper are indispensable for notes on the character sheet and for jotting down relevant story details, discovered clues, and maps of explored locations.
- **Index cards or Post-it notes:** Useful for marking notable elements of the game world, such as Tags. These small pieces of paper can be attached to the character sheet, the game map, or kept handy to remember important details or temporary game modifications.

### Game Modes

*Duskara* offers two game modes:

- **Classic:** In this mode, players immerse themselves in the game world under the guidance of a Game Master (GM), who narrates events, manages encounters and challenges, and responds to the characters' actions. It is the traditional approach, where the GM creates and maintains the world, while the players explore and interact with it through their characters. **This mode is used as the default in the game examples.**

- **GM-less:** This mode transforms the game into a unique collaborative experience, eliminating the role of the GM. Thanks to the action resolution system based on closed questions, with outcomes determined in an oracular manner, each player becomes responsible for their own action and can ask questions concerning their character. This system not only facilitates a fluid and shared narrative but also encourages a sense of collective discovery. In this way, all participants contribute equally to the story, guiding their adventures through the answers provided by the game itself.

- **Solo:** We recommend using [**Loner**](https://loner.zotiquestgames.com/#/it/), a derivative of FU specifically designed for solo role-playing. *Loner* guides the player through organizing a game independently, providing tools and advice on how to manage the narrative, encounters, and challenges without the need for other players. It is the perfect choice for those who want to venture alone into the imaginary worlds of RPGs, also offering support to newcomers on how to set up and experience their adventure in a fulfilling and complete way.

### Game Roles

#### Players

- **Move the player character (PC):** Each player controls their character's actions and movements within the game world.
- **Give voice and characterization:** Through narration and dialogue, players bring their characters to life, defining their personality, goals, and background.
- **Ask questions:** A fundamental part of the game is asking questions to explore the world, solve mysteries, or clarify aspects of the narrative.
- **Collaborate with others:** Players work together to build the story, avoiding using their character as a shield for behaviors harmful to the group.
- **Listen and reincorporate:** It is essential to listen to what other players add to the story and find ways to integrate these elements into your own play.

#### Game Master (GM)

The GM is also a player, but with specific tasks:

- **Manages the world and Non-Player Characters (NPCs):** Curates the setting and controls the NPCs, enriching the narrative with their presence.
- **Listens and reincorporates:** Like the players, the GM must be attentive to everyone's contributions and know how to weave together the elements brought to the game table.
- **Presents challenges:** Creates situations that test the characters, pushing them toward new adventures and personal growth.
- **Describes risks:** When players face important decisions, the GM clarifies the possible consequences of their actions.
- **Maintains clear dialogue:** Answers players' questions and asks new ones to ensure everyone understands the story's developments.
- **Adopts a participatory approach:** The GM acts in cooperation with the players, not as their adversary, to ensure a rewarding game experience for everyone.

### Safety Tools

In a game like *Duskara*, the well-being of all participants is fundamentally important. To ensure a welcoming and safe environment for players, it is essential to adopt safety tools such as [CATS](https://proleary.com/2016/04/25/the-cats-method-a-story-telling-game-opening-ritual/) (Concept, Aim, Tone, and Subject Matter) and [Script Change](https://thoughty.itch.io/script-change). These tools promote consent, mutual awareness, trust, and safety, allowing players to play mindfully. CATS encourages open communication about game expectations, while Script Change offers practical mechanisms to modify or stop the narrative when it ventures into potentially sensitive territories. Actively implementing these tools at the game table ensures that the adventure remains a positive and inclusive experience for all.

## The World of Duskara

### A World Between Light and Dark

In the year 2187, the colony ship *Stellar Horizon* departed Earth bound for Kepler-442b. After a critical malfunction during a solar storm, the ship drifted off course for decades while its passengers slept in cryogenic stasis. When emergency systems finally initiated revival protocols, they found themselves approaching an unknown star system. With failing life support and no way to correct their course, they were forced to land on Duskara—a tidally locked world that barely met the minimum requirements for human survival.

Now, eight centuries later, their descendants have not merely survived—they have adapted and thrived. This is not a story of desperate scarcity, but of ingenious harmony with a challenging world.

### The Twilight Belt

Humanity's home is a narrow band 200-300 kilometers wide that circles Duskara's meridian, caught between the scorching day side (where temperatures exceed 400°C) and the frozen night side (where the darkness is broken only by auroras and geothermal vents). Here, in perpetual twilight, temperatures range from temperate to moderately warm, and liquid water flows.

The eternal wind—born from the collision of extreme temperatures—shapes everything. Linear cities stretch along the habitable zone, their architecture harmonizing with the wind rather than fighting it. Soaring towers capture wind energy while deep foundations tap geothermal power. Vertical farms grow crops in precisely controlled microclimates. Every settlement is both fortress and garden, resilient and beautiful.

### The Awakening

The harsh conditions and unknown radiations of Duskara awakened latent abilities in its human inhabitants. These psychic gifts—thermal sensing, weather working, deep bonding with native life—are not supernatural but evolutionary. They represent humanity's communion with their new home.

Weather workers shape the wind to guide ships and protect settlements. Thermal sensitives navigate the day side margins where others would perish. Deep-cave dwellers on the night side communicate through resonance, their voices carrying through kilometers of stone. These abilities are celebrated, taught, and integrated into daily life.

### A Culture of Adaptation

Duskaran culture blends ancestral Earth traditions with innovations born of necessity. They measure time in wind cycles rather than day and night. Their architecture flows with environmental forces. Their festivals celebrate the planet's rhythms—the Storm Seasons, the Thermal Shifts, the Geothermal Awakenings.

Technology here is sophisticated but sustainable. Wind turbines and thermal exchangers provide abundant clean energy. Water reclamation systems make every drop count. Ancient satellites still orbit overhead, their data streams partially decoded. Some customs echo Earth's past; others are unique to this world where dawn never comes.

Governance varies between regions. Twilight belt cities operate under Councils of Windkeepers—representatives from resource guilds, Wind-Kin leaders, and elected delegates. Cave settlements are governed by Warmth Circles centered around geothermal hubs, often with hereditary leadership subject to communal approval. The Duskaran Accord binds these communities in a loose confederation focused on mutual survival.

Eighty percent of the population lives in twilight belt cities. Another fifteen percent inhabit the Deep Roads and night-side caverns, developing distinct cultures around geothermal warmth. The remaining five percent are nomads, traders, and explorers who traverse the dangerous margins.

### Mysteries and Wonders

Duskara holds secrets. Strange structures of unknown origin appear in the Deep Roads and night-side caverns—are they remnants of ancient Earth technology from the *Stellar Horizon*, natural geological formations, or something else entirely? The Twilight Codex, a collection of data fragments from the *Stellar Horizon*, remains partially encrypted. Unexplained phenomena occur in the Deep Roads, where tunnels seem to shift and strange echoes answer questions never asked. Some explorers report mechanisms that activate without explanation, creating both hazards and opportunities.

Explorers push into the day side margins to recover pre-landing artifacts. Cave divers descend into night-side chasms seeking geothermal sites. Archivists work to unlock Earth's lost knowledge. Each discovery adds another piece to the puzzle of humanity's place on this world.

### Themes of Play

Stories in Duskara can explore:

- **Environmental harmony:** Working with Duskara's forces rather than against them
- **Psychic communion:** The deepening connection between humans and their world
- **Resource innovation:** Clever solutions to engineering challenges
- **Cultural evolution:** How traditions adapt and new ones emerge
- **Planetary mystery:** Uncovering secrets of both Earth's past and Duskara's present
- **Community resilience:** How settlements cooperate and occasionally conflict
- **Heroic exploration:** Pushing boundaries in hostile but magnificent landscapes

This is planetary romance in the tradition of Burroughs and Brackett, updated with solarpunk sensibilities. Characters are competent, heroic, and resourceful. The planet is harsh but not cruel—it rewards understanding and cooperation. Technology serves human flourishing rather than dominating it.

Your stories will be of wonder and discovery, ingenuity and courage, community and connection. Duskara is home, and humanity has learned to thrive here.

## Character Creation

Creating a character in *Duskara* involves defining who they are through a series of Tags that capture their essence, abilities, and relationships. These Tags will guide your role-playing and influence your dice rolls throughout the game.

### Step 1: Concept

Your character's **Concept** is a brief phrase that captures their core identity. It should evoke their role in Duskaran society, their background, or their approach to life.

**Examples:**

- Wind-Blessed Navigator
- Thermal Prospector from the Day Margins
- Deep Roads Archive Keeper
- Storm Season Festival Organizer
- Geothermal Engineer
- Weather Worker Apprentice
- Nomadic Water Trader
- Night-Side Resonance Singer
- Windkeeper Councilor
- Warmth Circle Elder

Your Concept can add a Chance Die when it's relevant to your action.

### Step 2: Skills

Choose **three Skills** that represent your character's training, expertise, or natural talents. Skills in Duskara often reflect the unique demands of the setting.

**Sample Skills:**

- Wind Pattern Reading
- Thermal Suit Operation
- Vertical Farming
- Weather Working
- Ancient Technology
- Cave Navigation
- Storm Ship Piloting
- Water System Maintenance
- Psychic Resonance
- Geothermal Prospecting
- Archival Research
- Wind Turbine Engineering
- Thermal Sensing
- Deep Bonding
- Settlement Politics
- Survival (Day Side / Night Side / Deep Roads)

Each Skill can add a Chance Die when you use it.

### Step 3: Frailty

Every character has a **Frailty**—something that challenges them or makes certain situations more difficult. This isn't a flaw that weakens your character, but a human vulnerability that adds depth.

**Examples:**

- Overwhelmed by Thermal Noise
- Uncomfortable in Enclosed Spaces
- Haunted by the Lost Earth
- Overconfident in Their Abilities
- Struggles with Weather Working Focus
- Distrusts Night-Side Cultures
- Addicted to Storm Chasing
- Poor Wind Sense

Your Frailty adds a Risk Die when it comes into play.

### Step 4: Gear

Choose **two pieces of Gear** that your character typically carries. Gear in Duskara is often multi-purpose and reflects the setting's sustainable technology.

**Sample Gear:**

- Thermal Suit (rated for marginal day-side exposure)
- Wind Compass (reads current patterns)
- Comm Crystal (synced to settlement network)
- Climbing Kit (for towers or caves)
- Water Reclamation Unit (personal scale)
- Data Crystal (containing Earth archives or technical schematics)
- Resonance Bell (for deep-cave communication)
- Storm Goggles (protects against wind and dust)
- Thermal Lance (mining/cutting tool)
- Bio-Monitor (tracks environmental exposure)

Each piece of Gear can add a Chance Die when relevant.

### Step 5: Goal

What does your character want to achieve? Your **Goal** is your driving ambition, the thing that pulls you into adventure.

**Examples:**

- Decode the Twilight Codex fragments
- Establish a new settlement in the twilight belt
- Master weather working to legendary status
- Map the complete Deep Roads network
- Find a way to restore contact with Earth
- Discover the origin of Duskara's ancient structures
- Protect their settlement from a rival's expansion
- Recover lost technology from the day side

Your Goal can add a Chance Die when you're working toward it.

### Step 6: Motive

Your **Motive** explains *why* you pursue your Goal. It's the emotional or philosophical drive behind your ambition.

**Examples:**

- To honor the sacrifices of the *Stellar Horizon* crew
- To prove that humanity can truly thrive on Duskara
- To ensure their settlement's independence
- To understand their psychic connection to the planet
- To preserve knowledge for future generations
- To find meaning in a world they didn't choose
- To protect those they love from hardship
- To satisfy an unquenchable curiosity

Your Motive can add a Chance Die when it's directly relevant.

### Step 7: Nemesis

Choose a **Nemesis**—a person, organization, force, or concept that opposes your character or complicates their life. This creates built-in drama and conflict.

**Examples:**

- A rival weather worker from another settlement
- Windkeepers who restrict access to Earth data or resources
- The day side's relentless environmental pressures
- A family member who thinks their Goal is foolish
- A corporation exploiting geothermal sites irresponsibly
- The mysterious phenomena in the Deep Roads
- Their own psychic abilities, which they fear or distrust
- A settlement that competes for the same resources

Your Nemesis adds a Risk Die when they're involved or relevant.

### Step 8: Relationships

Establish **two Relationships** with other player characters. These should be connections that create interesting dynamics and story hooks.

**Examples:**

- Taught them weather working basics
- Saved their life during a superstorm
- Grew up in the same settlement
- Rival for a romantic interest
- Siblings separated by cultural differences
- Partners in exploring the Deep Roads
- Mentor and former student
- Competing for the same settlement contract

Relationships can add Chance Dice or Risk Dice depending on the situation and how the relationship is currently standing.

### Psychic Abilities (Optional)

If your character has manifested psychic abilities—a product of Duskara's evolutionary pressures—choose one to start. More can be developed through play.

See the **Psychic Abilities** section for details on how these work mechanically.

### Example Character

**Kael Zephyros**

- **Concept:** Day-Side Salvage Specialist
- **Skills:** Thermal Suit Operation, Ancient Technology, Survival (Day Side)
- **Frailty:** Overconfident in Their Abilities
- **Gear:** Thermal Suit (heavy-duty), Thermal Lance
- **Goal:** Recover the *Stellar Horizon*'s navigation core from the day side wreckage
- **Motive:** To prove humanity can reclaim what was lost
- **Nemesis:** The Day Side Trading Consortium who claims exclusive salvage rights
- **Relationships:**
  - "Trained Mira in thermal sensing before her Awakening"
  - "Owes Thalen a life-debt after a rescue mission went wrong"
- **Psychic Ability:** Thermal Sense (Novice)

## Core Mechanics

### The Basic Roll

When the outcome of a character's action is uncertain or risky, the game uses a simple dice mechanic to determine what happens.

**Step 1: Frame the Action as a Closed Question**

Before rolling, frame the action as a question that can be answered with "Yes" or "No."

**Examples:**

- "Can I navigate through the superstorm to reach the settlement?"
- "Do I sense the thermal vents through the cave wall?"
- "Can I convince the Council of Windkeepers to grant me access to the archives?"

**Step 2: Assemble Your Dice Pool**

Start with one **Action Die** (d6). This die is always rolled.

Then add:

- **Chance Dice** (d6) for each advantage, favorable Tag, or helpful circumstance
- **Risk Dice** (d6) for each disadvantage, opposing Tag, or complicating factor

**Chance and Risk Dice cancel each other out 1:1.** Only roll the remaining dice after cancellation.

**Step 3: Roll and Read the Dice**

Roll all dice in your pool. The **highest single die** determines the outcome:

| Highest Die | Outcome |
|-------------|---------|
| **6** | **Yes, and...** The action succeeds, and something extra happens in your favor |
| **5** | **Yes...** The action succeeds as intended |
| **4** | **Yes, but...** The action succeeds, but there's a complication or cost |
| **3** | **No, but...** The action fails, but you gain something or avoid the worst |
| **2** | **No...** The action fails as expected |
| **1** | **No, and...** The action fails, and something extra goes wrong |

**If you roll multiple dice of the same highest value,** the result shifts one step toward "Yes" (in your favor).

**Examples:**

- Two 5s = "Yes, and..."
- Two 4s = "Yes..."
- Two 3s = "No..."
- Two 2s = "No, but..."

### When to Roll

Not every action requires a roll. Use the dice when:

- **The outcome is uncertain**
- **Failure has interesting consequences**
- **Success isn't guaranteed**

Don't roll when:

- **Success is automatic** (the character's Tags clearly outweigh obstacles)
- **Failure is automatic** (the action is impossible given the circumstances)
- **The outcome doesn't matter to the story**

### Zoom In / Zoom Out

You can approach any situation at different levels of detail:

**Zoom Out:** Resolve the entire scene with a single closed question and one roll.

- "Do we make it across the Deep Roads to the next settlement before our supplies run out?"

**Zoom In:** Break the scene into multiple questions, each requiring its own roll.

- "Can I spot the correct tunnel branch?"
- "Do I notice the unstable rock formation before it collapses?"
- "Can I repair the damaged water reclamation unit?"

Choose the approach that serves the story and creates the most engaging play.

### Tags as Tools

Tags are short phrases that describe anything important in the game—characters, objects, locations, situations. They're the primary way advantages and disadvantages are determined.

**Using Tags:**

- When a Tag is relevant and helpful to your action, add a Chance Die
- When a Tag works against you, add a Risk Die
- The GM (or group consensus in GM-less play) decides which Tags apply

**Examples:**

- Your "Weather Working" Skill adds a Chance Die when you try to calm the winds around your settlement
- Your "Overwhelmed by Thermal Noise" Frailty adds a Risk Die when you enter the sweltering margins of the day side
- The scene Tag "Superstorm Approaching" adds a Risk Die to outdoor travel
- Your "Wind Compass" Gear adds a Chance Die when navigating by wind patterns

### Conditions

When something happens that temporarily affects your character—injury, exhaustion, fear—you gain a **Condition** Tag.

**Examples:**

- Injured
- Exhausted
- Frightened
- Overheated
- Disoriented
- Psychically Drained

Conditions add Risk Dice when relevant. They're removed through:

- Medical attention (for physical Conditions)
- Rest and recovery (for exhaustion or psychic depletion)
- Narrative resolution (for emotional or situational Conditions)

The GM or group determines when a Condition is severe enough to persist and when it can be cleared.

### Details and Scene Tags

The environment itself has Tags that emerge from play:

- **"Wind Turbines Damaged"** (adds Risk Dice to power-dependent actions)
- **"Geothermal Vent Nearby"** (adds Chance Dice to staying warm)
- **"Storm Clouds Gathering"** (adds Risk Dice to outdoor activity)
- **"Ancient Structure Discovered"** (adds Chance Dice to research or exploration)

These Tags remain in play until the fiction changes them. Players and GMs create and modify them through successful actions and narrative developments.

### Opposition

When facing sapient opposition (NPCs, creatures, rival settlements), their relevant Tags add Risk Dice to your roll. The GM can frame their own closed questions for NPCs taking independent action.

Major NPCs might have their own Concept, Skills, and Gear, which function like player character Tags.

## Psychic Abilities

The harsh environment and unknown radiations of Duskara awakened latent psychic abilities in its human inhabitants. These aren't supernatural powers, but evolutionary adaptations—humanity's communion with the planet that has become their home.

### How Psychic Abilities Work

Psychic abilities function as specialized Skills with additional considerations:

1. **They add Chance Dice when relevant**, just like normal Skills
2. **They have associated costs or risks** that create Conditions or complications
3. **They grow stronger through use and training**

### Core Psychic Abilities

#### Weather Working

The ability to sense and subtly influence atmospheric patterns—wind speed, pressure changes, storm formation.

**Applications:**

- Predicting storm movements hours or days in advance
- Calming destructive winds around settlements or ships
- Guiding favorable breezes to assist travelers
- Sensing optimal paths through dangerous weather

**Cost:** Using Weather Working for significant effects (calming a superstorm, redirecting major wind patterns) creates the **Psychically Drained** Condition, adding Risk Dice to further psychic use until you rest.

**Progression:**

- **Novice:** Sense weather patterns, predict storms
- **Adept:** Influence local winds, guide small weather systems
- **Master:** Calm superstorms, redirect major atmospheric phenomena

#### Thermal Sense

The ability to perceive heat signatures and temperature gradients with extraordinary precision.

**Applications:**

- Navigating by heat differentials in caves or during storms
- Detecting geothermal vents through solid rock
- Sensing living creatures by their body heat
- Operating safely in extreme thermal environments

**Cost:** Prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures (day side margins, deep geothermal sites) creates the **Overwhelmed by Thermal Noise** Condition, adding Risk Dice to Thermal Sense use and concentration-based actions until you return to moderate temperatures.

**Progression:**

- **Novice:** Sense temperature differences, detect obvious heat sources
- **Adept:** Perceive through obstacles, operate in extreme heat
- **Master:** Map complex thermal patterns, sense minute temperature variations

#### Deep Bonding

The ability to form psychic connections with Duskara's native life forms and, at higher levels, with other bonded humans.

**Applications:**

- Communicating basic concepts with indigenous creatures
- Sensing the emotional states of bonded organisms
- Sharing sensory information with bonded partners
- Coordinating actions telepathically in crisis situations

**Cost:** Breaking or losing a deep bond (through death or separation) creates the **Grief-Struck** Condition, adding Risk Dice to concentration and social interactions until processed through mourning or ritual.

**Progression:**

- **Novice:** Bond with one simple organism, sense basic emotions
- **Adept:** Bond with multiple creatures, share surface thoughts with willing humans
- **Master:** Form complex bonds, maintain group telepathic coordination

#### Resonance

The ability to perceive and manipulate vibrations through solid matter—primarily used in cave systems.

**Applications:**

- Detecting structural weaknesses in rock or construction
- Communicating through stone over vast distances
- Sensing movement and presence in adjacent chambers
- Identifying mineral and water deposits by their resonant patterns

**Cost:** Extended resonance use in complex systems creates the **Disoriented** Condition, as sensory input becomes overwhelming. Adds Risk Dice to navigation and perception until you spend time in silence.

**Progression:**

- **Novice:** Detect vibrations, send simple signals through stone
- **Adept:** Communicate complex information, map nearby cavern systems
- **Master:** Perceive vast underground networks, identify specific individuals by their resonant signature

**Deepkin Variants:**

- **Echo Empathy:** Deepkin psychics interpret sound and vibrations with extraordinary precision, creating detailed mental maps of cave systems. This goes beyond standard Resonance, turning echoes into full sensory experiences.
- **Void Attunement:** Masters of darkness can tune their minds to subtle psychic currents in the profound silence of the night side, detecting distant disturbances or threats through the rock itself.

### Deepkin Psychic Specializations

Cave dwellers have developed unique psychic adaptations beyond the core abilities:

#### Shadow Sight

An advanced form of Thermal Sense specific to Deepkin, allowing perception of heat gradients with unparalleled precision in total darkness.

**Applications:**

- Navigate cave systems without any light source
- Detect minute temperature variations through solid rock
- Track creatures by residual heat signatures
- Sense geothermal flows deep underground

**Cost:** Exposure to bright light creates the **Light-Blind** Condition temporarily, adding Risk Dice to vision-based actions until eyes readjust.

**Progression:**

- **Novice:** See in complete darkness via heat
- **Adept:** Perceive through obstacles, detect distant heat sources
- **Master:** Map entire geothermal networks mentally

#### Dark Bonding

A specialized form of Deep Bonding that creates profound telepathic connections with underground fauna.

**Applications:**

- Share senses with bonded creatures (glowworms, thermal lizards, shadow serpents)
- Use bonded partners as scouts in dangerous areas
- Coordinate complex actions telepathically with multiple bonded creatures
- Experience the world through non-human sensory systems

**Cost:** Stronger than standard Deep Bonding but with greater risk—losing a Dark Bonded partner creates the **Soul-Scarred** Condition, which can take months to heal.

#### Geothermal Communion

A weatherworking variant that manipulates heat flows rather than wind patterns.

**Applications:**

- Stabilize temperatures in cave settlements
- Redirect geothermal energy to warm specific areas
- Predict volcanic or thermal events
- Enhance thermal harvester efficiency

**Cost:** Prolonged communion creates the **Heat-Touched** Condition, making the psychic uncomfortably warm and adding Risk Dice to physical exertion.

### Awakening New Abilities

Characters can develop psychic abilities through:

- **Environmental exposure:** Spending significant time in extreme conditions (day margins, deep caves, storm centers)
- **Training:** Working with experienced psychics in formal or informal education
- **Crisis awakening:** Sudden manifestation during life-threatening situations
- **Voluntary augmentation:** Using ancient technology or meditation techniques to unlock latent potential

The GM and player should collaborate on when and how new abilities emerge, ensuring they feel earned rather than arbitrary.

### Using Psychic Abilities in Play

When framing a closed question that involves psychic abilities:

1. **Identify which ability applies**
2. **Add a Chance Die for the ability itself**
3. **Consider environmental factors** (appropriate conditions add more Chance Dice; hostile environments add Risk Dice)
4. **Determine if cost applies** (significant or extended use triggers Conditions)
5. **Describe the psychic experience** in the fiction

**Example:**

Mira wants to calm the winds around their settlement as a superstorm approaches.

- **Question:** "Can I use Weather Working to redirect the worst of the storm?"
- **Dice Pool:**
  - 1 Action Die (always)
  - +1 Chance Die (Weather Working Skill)
  - +1 Chance Die (standing atop the settlement's weather spire, optimal position)
  - +2 Risk Dice (superstorm is massive and chaotic)
  - After cancellation: 1 Action Die + 0 extra dice
- **Cost:** Success will trigger **Psychically Drained** Condition
- **Roll:** Mira rolls the Action Die, gets a 4
- **Outcome:** "Yes, but..." The storm is redirected enough to save the settlement, but Mira collapses from the effort and will need significant rest

## Environmental Zones

Duskara's three zones—the Day Side, the Twilight Belt, and the Night Side—are more than scenery. They actively shape gameplay by modifying dice pools and creating narrative constraints.

### Zone-Based Dice Modifiers

Whenever a character takes action in a specific zone, automatically apply the zone's base modifiers **before** considering character Tags or situational factors.

#### Day Side

**Base Modifier:** +2 Risk Dice to all physical actions
**Reason:** Extreme heat, radiation exposure, equipment degradation

**Additional Considerations:**

- Characters without thermal protection automatically gain the **Overheating** Condition within minutes
- Unshielded equipment fails within hours
- Communication systems suffer interference
- Water consumption increases dramatically

**Exceptions:**

- Characters with Master-level Thermal Sense reduce Risk Dice by 1
- Heavy-duty thermal suits reduce Risk Dice by 1
- Robotic or remote operations can ignore physical Risk Dice

**Opportunities:**

- Rare mineral deposits (add Chance Dice to prospecting/salvage)
- Ancient wreckage sites (add Chance Dice to archaeological research)
- Clear thermal signatures (add Chance Dice to Thermal Sense tracking)

#### Twilight Belt

**Base Modifier:** None (neutral ground)
**Reason:** This is humanity's adapted habitat

**Characteristics:**

- Wind is constant but manageable
- Resources are scarce but available
- Temperatures are tolerable
- Settlements provide infrastructure support

**Dynamic Conditions:**

- Storm Season: +1 Risk Die to outdoor activity
- Wind Turbine Maintenance: +1 Chance Die to power-dependent actions
- Water Rationing: +1 Risk Die to resource-intensive activity
- Festival Season: +1 Chance Die to social interactions

#### Night Side

**Base Modifier:** +1 Risk Die to navigation and perception (darkness)
**Reason:** Perpetual darkness, disorienting environment

**Additional Considerations:**

- Characters without thermal protection gain the **Freezing** Condition within hours
- Navigation requires Resonance, bioluminescent guides, or technological aids
- Geothermal sites negate cold-related Risk Dice within their immediate area
- Cave systems amplify Resonance abilities (add Chance Dice)

**Exceptions:**

- Night-side natives or those with extensive cave experience reduce Risk Dice by 1
- Resonance users can navigate without penalty in familiar cavern systems
- Geothermal zones function as safe havens

**Opportunities:**

- Geothermal vents (add Chance Dice to warmth-related survival)
- Mineral seams (add Chance Dice to mining/prospecting)
- Bioluminescent ecosystems (add Chance Dice to biological research)
- Acoustic clarity (add Chance Dice to Resonance communication)

### Transition Zones

The margins between zones are the most dangerous:

**Day-Twilight Margin**

- Temperature swings create violent updrafts
- Superstorms spawn here regularly
- +2 Risk Dice to outdoor activity during storm formation
- Salvage teams and thermal prospectors operate here

**Twilight-Night Margin**

- Stable but dark, minimal wind
- Entrances to Deep Roads are common
- +1 Risk Die to outdoor navigation without guidance

### Using Zones in Play

**GM Guidance:**

1. **Announce the zone** when characters enter or the scene shifts
2. **Apply base modifiers automatically**
3. **Layer on situational Tags** from there (weather, equipment, character abilities)
4. **Use zones to create tension:** approaching the day side should feel increasingly dangerous

**Player Awareness:**

- Players should know which zone they're in
- Players should understand the base risk of operating there
- Players should plan around environmental realities

**Example:**

Kael is attempting to salvage technology from day side wreckage.

- **Zone:** Day Side (+2 Risk Dice automatically)
- **Kael's Tags:**
  - Heavy-Duty Thermal Suit (Gear): +1 Chance Die, reduces zone penalty by 1
  - Thermal Suit Operation (Skill): +1 Chance Die
  - Survival (Day Side) (Skill): +1 Chance Die
- **Situational:**
  - Solar storm incoming (scene Tag): +1 Risk Die
  - Ancient salvage site (scene Tag): +1 Chance Die
- **Final Pool:**
  - 1 Action Die
  - +4 Chance Dice
  - +2 Risk Dice (zone baseline, reduced by thermal suit)
  - +1 Risk Die (solar storm)
  - Net: 1 Action Die + 1 Chance Die

### Zone-Specific Challenges

Different zones naturally create different types of stories:

**Day Side Stories:**

- Salvage and recovery missions
- Scientific exploration
- Desperate escapes
- Mining operations
- Thermal ability training

**Twilight Belt Stories:**

- Settlement politics and cooperation
- Resource management
- Cultural festivals and gatherings
- Weather worker training
- Defense against superstorms

**Night Side Stories:**

- Deep Roads exploration
- Geothermal site discovery
- Cave culture immersion
- Ancient structure investigation
- Resonance ceremonies

## Resource Management

While *Duskara* focuses on emergent narrative, resource scarcity is central to the setting. This system keeps resources present without turning the game into a spreadsheet.

### Core Resources

Three resources matter on Duskara:

**Water:** Precious, carefully recycled, never wasted
**Power:** Generated by wind and geothermal, distributed through networks
**Provisions:** Food, medicine, equipment—anything consumed or expended

### Resource Tags

Rather than tracking exact quantities, settlements and groups have **Resource Status Tags** that reflect current conditions:

**Water Status:**

- "Water Abundant" (+1 Chance Die to hygiene, agriculture, morale)
- "Water Adequate" (no modifier)
- "Water Rationing" (+1 Risk Die to physically demanding actions)
- "Water Crisis" (+2 Risk Dice to all activity, settlement survival threatened)

**Power Status:**

- "Full Power Grid" (+1 Chance Die to technology use, communication, comfort)
- "Adequate Power" (no modifier)
- "Rolling Blackouts" (+1 Risk Die to power-dependent systems)
- "Power Failure" (+2 Risk Dice to technology, critical systems down)

**Provision Status:**

- "Well-Supplied" (+1 Chance Die to morale, health, expedition preparation)
- "Adequate Supplies" (no modifier)
- "Supplies Running Low" (+1 Risk Die to extended activity, health)
- "Critical Shortage" (+2 Risk Dice to survival actions, morale collapses)

### How Resource Tags Change

Resource status shifts through:

**Negative Triggers:**

- Storm damage to infrastructure
- Population increase or refugee arrival
- Trade route disruption
- Equipment failure
- Prolonged expedition or siege
- Failed rationing or conservation efforts

**Positive Triggers:**

- Successful resource acquisition (water prospecting, supply caravan arrival)
- Infrastructure repair or expansion
- Breakthrough conservation technology
- Trade agreement with other settlements
- Abundant geothermal or wind conditions
- Community cooperation initiatives

### Personal Resources

Individual characters don't track resources separately unless they're isolated from settlements for extended periods.

When undertaking major expeditions (deep day-side salvage, long Deep Roads traverses), the GM may assign a **Supplies** Tag to the expedition:

- "Well-Provisioned" (+1 Chance Die to survival actions)
- "Adequate Supplies" (no modifier)
- "Low Supplies" (+1 Risk Die, group must find resources soon)
- "Out of Supplies" (+2 Risk Dice, survival crisis)

This Tag degrades based on time, mishaps, and consumption. It improves through finding caches, successful hunting/foraging, or reaching safe havens.

### Using Resources in Play

**GM Responsibilities:**

- Announce current settlement Resource Tags at session start
- Shift Tags when fictional triggers occur
- Apply modifiers to relevant rolls
- Create adventure hooks around resource crises

**Player Opportunities:**

- Plan expeditions to improve resource status
- Propose engineering or social solutions
- Accept complications that worsen resource Tags for dramatic effect
- Celebrate when resource status improves

**Example:**

The settlement of Aetherion is under "Water Rationing" due to damaged aquifer pumps. The players undertake a mission to repair the pumps in the Deep Roads.

- All physically demanding actions in the settlement have +1 Risk Die
- Characters working in vertical farms struggle to maintain crops
- Social tensions increase as rationing enforcement becomes stricter
- Upon successful repair, Aetherion returns to "Water Adequate"
- Community morale improves, and the characters are celebrated

### Resource Conflict

Competing settlements may clash over resources:

- Disputed geothermal sites
- Shared aquifer access
- Trade route control
- Salvage claim conflicts

These conflicts create excellent adventure frameworks without requiring detailed economic simulation.

## Wind and Storm Conditions

The eternal wind is more than scenery—it's a living presence that shapes every moment on Duskara. This section provides mechanical structure for wind's influence on play.

### Wind Intensity Levels

Wind conditions are represented by **Scene Tags** that apply modifiers to actions:

#### Calm (Deep Caves, Sheltered Valleys)

**Modifier:** None
**Description:** Air is still or barely moving. Unusual outside of protected spaces.
**Effects:**

- No penalties or bonuses
- Uncommon in twilight belt; indicates either sheltered location or ominous stillness before major storm

#### Steady Wind (Twilight Belt Normal)

**Modifier:** None
**Description:** Constant, predictable wind at 20-40 km/h. This is Duskara's baseline.
**Effects:**

- This is normal; characters are adapted to it
- Wind turbines operate optimally
- Travel and communication proceed normally

#### Strong Wind (Storm Front Approaching)

**Modifier:** +1 Risk Die to outdoor physical actions
**Description:** Wind at 50-80 km/h, with gusts. Storm systems building.
**Effects:**

- Outdoor movement becomes difficult
- Loose objects blow away
- Communication requires raised voices or tech assistance
- Wind turbines strain but produce extra power

#### Gale (Superstorm Margins)

**Modifier:** +2 Risk Dice to outdoor actions, +1 Risk Die to structural integrity
**Description:** Wind at 90-120 km/h. Dangerous to be outside.
**Effects:**

- Travel requires Weather Working support or heavy vehicles
- Exposed structures risk damage
- Visibility severely reduced by dust and debris
- Only experienced weather workers attempt to influence conditions

#### Superstorm (Catastrophic Event)

**Modifier:** +3 Risk Dice to all outdoor actions, +2 Risk Dice to structures
**Description:** Wind exceeding 150 km/h. Extreme danger.
**Effects:**

- Outdoor activity is nearly suicidal
- Buildings must be specifically reinforced against superstorms
- Even weather workers struggle to moderate these forces
- Settlements go into emergency lockdown
- Storm may last hours or days

### Storm Season

Duskara's storm patterns follow predictable cycles based on thermal differentials:

**Peak Storm Season:** Several times per local year, when day-night thermal contrast is maximal

- Superstorms occur more frequently
- Settlements prepare with reinforcement and stockpiling
- Travel between settlements becomes extremely dangerous
- Weather workers are in high demand

**Quiet Season:** Periods of relatively stable atmospheric conditions

- Strong winds are less common
- Optimal time for day-side salvage operations
- Inter-settlement trade increases
- Expansion and construction projects proceed

### Using Wind Mechanically

**Dynamic Scene Tags:**

The GM can introduce or shift wind Tags based on:

- Narrative pacing (introduce storms for dramatic tension)
- Character actions (Weather Working shifts conditions)
- Logical progression (storms build over time, don't appear instantly)
- Player requests (players can suggest wind shifts for dramatic effect)

**Weather Working Interaction:**

When characters use Weather Working to influence wind conditions:

1. Frame a closed question: "Can I calm the gale enough for us to cross safely?"
2. Apply the current wind condition as Risk Dice
3. Apply Weather Working Skill as Chance Die
4. Add situational modifiers (position, environmental support, etc.)
5. Resolve the roll
6. On success, shift the wind Tag one step calmer
7. Apply psychic cost (Psychically Drained Condition for significant shifts)

**Example:**

A superstorm approaches Aetherion settlement. The wind shifts from "Strong Wind" to "Gale" as the system arrives. The weather worker on duty, Thalen, attempts to redirect the worst of it.

- **Current Tag:** "Gale" (+2 Risk Dice)
- **Thalen's Pool:**
  - Weather Working (Skill): +1 Chance Die
  - Positioned on Weather Spire (optimal location): +1 Chance Die
  - Storm Season (opposing force): +1 Risk Die
  - Goal is to protect settlement: +1 Chance Die
- **Net Pool:** 1 Action Die + 1 Chance Die
- **Roll:** Thalen rolls two dice (Action + 1 Chance), gets a 5 and a 3
- **Outcome:** "Yes..." The gale is moderated to "Strong Wind," and the settlement is spared major damage. Thalen gains **Psychically Drained** and will need rest.

## The Deep Roads

The Deep Roads are a vast network of tunnels begun by early human settlers to connect twilight belt settlements to night-side geothermal zones. During the consolidation period of Duskaran civilization, many sections were abandoned due to resource constraints and structural instability. Centuries later, these ancient passages were rediscovered and expanded, incorporating natural cave systems and new excavations. Some sections follow geological formations—underground rivers, lava tubes, fault lines—while others are clearly the work of human engineering.

Exploring the Deep Roads is one of Duskara's signature experiences—equal parts discovery, danger, and mystery.

### Navigation in the Deep Roads

Navigating the Deep Roads uses a **Progress Clock** approach:

1. **Establish the Journey:** Define the destination and distance (near/moderate/far/extreme)
2. **Create a Progress Clock:** Segment the journey into steps (4 segments for near, 6 for moderate, 8 for far, 12 for extreme)
3. **Frame Closed Questions:** At key points, ask questions about progress:
   - "Do we find the correct branch in this junction?"
   - "Can we cross the collapsed section safely?"
   - "Do we notice the unstable rock before it collapses?"
4. **Advance on Success:** Mark segments on the clock for each successful question
   - "Yes, and..." = 2 segments
   - "Yes..." = 1 segment
   - "Yes, but..." = 1 segment (with complication)
5. **Complications on Failure:**
   - "No, but..." = 0 segments (but something good happens)
   - "No..." = 0 segments
   - "No, and..." = 0 segments and crisis

### Deep Roads Hazards

The Deep Roads are not passive tunnels. Hazards are represented as **Scene Tags** that add Risk Dice:

**Structural Hazards:**

- "Unstable Ceiling" (+1 Risk Die to movement and noise)
- "Flooded Passage" (+1 Risk Die to progress, equipment damage risk)
- "Narrow Squeeze" (+1 Risk Die to armored or encumbered characters)
- "Sheer Drop" (+2 Risk Dice without climbing equipment)

**Environmental Hazards:**

- "Freezing Cold" (+1 Risk Die without thermal protection)
- "Toxic Gas" (+2 Risk Dice without respirators)
- "Absolute Darkness" (+1 Risk Die to perception without light or Resonance)
- "Disorienting Acoustics" (+1 Risk Die to Resonance communication)

**Unknown Hazards:**

- "Strange Echoes" (unknown effect until investigated)
- "Shifting Tunnels" (paths that seem to change)
- "Psychic Interference" (disrupts psychic abilities)

### Discovery and Rewards

The Deep Roads contain wonders:

**Geothermal Sites:**

- New vents can support settlements or outposts
- Provides heat, power, mineral deposits

**Ancient Structures:**

- Pre-human architecture of unknown origin
- Potential technology, knowledge, or mysteries

**Lost Caches:**

- Supplies left by previous expeditions
- Salvage from early settlement attempts
- Data crystals with fragmentary records

**Native Ecosystems:**

- Bioluminescent flora and fauna
- Opportunities for Deep Bonding
- Pharmaceutical or nutritional resources

Use discoveries to:

- Advance character Goals
- Improve settlement Resource Tags
- Introduce new mysteries
- Reward bold exploration

### Example Deep Roads Expedition

**Setup:**
The characters are traveling from Aetherion (twilight belt) to Khoros Deep (night-side geothermal settlement). This is a "moderate" journey (6-segment Progress Clock).

**Segment 1: Departure**

- **Question:** "Do we navigate the initial tunnels without incident?"
- **Dice Pool:** 1 Action Die + Chance Dice (Cave Navigation Skill, Wind Compass guidance) - Risk Dice (Absolute Darkness Tag)
- **Result:** "Yes..." → Mark 1 segment

**Segment 2: Junction**

- **Question:** "Can we identify the correct branch using Resonance?"
- **Dice Pool:** 1 Action Die + Chance Dice (Resonance Skill, past experience) - Risk Dice (Disorienting Acoustics Tag)
- **Result:** "No, but..." → Mark 0 segments, but they discover a shortcut (add +1 Chance Die to next roll)

**Segment 3: Flooded Passage**

- **Question:** "Do we cross the flooded section without damaging our equipment?"
- **Dice Pool:** 1 Action Die + Chance Dice (previous shortcut bonus, climbing kit) - Risk Dice (Flooded Passage Tag)
- **Result:** "Yes, but..." → Mark 1 segment, but one character's comm crystal shorts out

**Segments 4-6:** Continue until Progress Clock fills or crisis forces a detour.

## Encounters and Conflicts

*Duskara* is not a combat-focused game, but conflicts—physical, social, or environmental—are inevitable. This section provides structure for resolving meaningful confrontations.

### Conflict Types

#### Physical Confrontation

Direct action between characters or against hostile forces.

**Examples:**

- Defending a settlement from claim-jumpers
- Escaping a collapsing cavern
- Subduing a panicked storm-beast

**Resolution:**

- Frame as closed questions: "Can I disarm the rival before they sabotage the turbine?"
- Apply relevant Tags (combat Skills, environmental factors, opponent's abilities)
- Interpret outcomes narratively, not as hit points

#### Social Confrontation

Persuasion, negotiation, deception, or manipulation.

**Examples:**

- Convincing the Council to fund an expedition
- Negotiating water rights between settlements
- Deceiving a rival about the location of a salvage site

**Resolution:**

- Frame as closed questions: "Can I persuade the Archivists to grant me access to restricted data?"
- Apply relevant Tags (social Skills, Relationships, Nemesis opposition)
- Consider long-term consequences of outcomes

#### Environmental Confrontation

Surviving or overcoming natural hazards.

**Examples:**

- Navigating a superstorm
- Surviving a thermal surge on the day side
- Escaping a collapsing tunnel

**Resolution:**

- Frame as closed questions: "Can we reach shelter before the superstorm hits?"
- Apply environmental zone modifiers and hazard Tags
- Use psychic abilities where appropriate

### Opposition Strength

When facing sapient opposition, their strength is represented by adding Risk Dice:

**Minor Opposition:** +1 Risk Die

- Inexperienced rivals
- Small-scale threats
- Routine challenges

**Moderate Opposition:** +2 Risk Dice

- Skilled opponents
- Organized groups
- Significant hazards

**Major Opposition:** +3 Risk Dice

- Legendary figures
- Elite forces
- Catastrophic threats

NPCs may also have their own Tags (Concept, Skills, Gear) that add additional Risk Dice when relevant.

### Creatures and Native Life

Duskara's native life has adapted to the planet's extreme conditions. Most creatures are not hostile, but they can be dangerous when threatened or when their territories overlap with human activity.

See the **Creatures and Enemies** section for specific examples.

### Zoom In vs. Zoom Out in Conflicts

**Zoom Out:** Resolve the entire confrontation with a single question.

- "Do we drive off the claim-jumpers and secure the mining site?"
- Fast resolution, emphasizes outcome over details
- Best for conflicts where specifics aren't crucial

**Zoom In:** Break the confrontation into multiple questions.

- "Can I identify their leader?"
- "Do I convince the leader to negotiate?"
- "Can I disarm the hostile faction member?"
- Detailed, tense, allows for tactical decisions
- Best for climactic or complex confrontations

Choose based on narrative importance and player engagement.

### Example Conflict

**Situation:** The characters are defending their settlement's water reclamation station from saboteurs hired by a rival settlement.

**Approach:** Zoom In (multiple questions for tension)

**Question 1:** "Can I spot the saboteurs before they reach the pumps?"

- **Dice Pool:** 1 Action Die + Chance Die (Perception Skill, high vantage point) - Risk Die (darkness, saboteurs are experienced)
- **Result:** "Yes, but..." → You spot them, but they see you too and split up

**Question 2:** "Can I intercept the one heading for the main control panel?"

- **Dice Pool:** 1 Action Die + Chance Dice (athleticism, knowledge of station layout) - Risk Dice (saboteur's evasion skill, low light)
- **Result:** "No, but..." → You don't catch them, but you trigger the alarm, alerting the settlement

**Question 3:** "Can I talk the saboteur down before they complete their mission?"

- **Dice Pool:** 1 Action Die + Chance Dice (Relationship with rival settlement, appeals to shared values) - Risk Dice (saboteur's loyalty to employer, time pressure)
- **Result:** "Yes, and..." → The saboteur stands down, and reveals who hired them

### Consequences

Conflicts should have lasting impacts:

**Physical:** Conditions (Injured, Exhausted), gear damage, environmental changes
**Social:** Relationship shifts, reputation changes, new alliances or Nemeses
**Environmental:** Structural damage to settlements, resource status degradation, ecological disruption

## Example of Play

This extended example demonstrates how *Duskara* plays at the table, showcasing the interplay of fiction, mechanics, and collaborative storytelling.

### The Setup

**GM:** "You're standing on the observation platform at the top of Aetherion' central spire. The wind is strong—steady at about 60 kilometers per hour—and you can see storm clouds gathering on the day-side horizon. Kael, you've been scanning the thermal signatures all morning. What do you see?"

**Kael's Player:** "I'm using my Thermal Sense to check if the mining drones are still operational out in the day margins. Have they sent back any signals?"

**GM:** "Good question. Let's frame that as: 'Can you detect the thermal signatures of the drones through the storm interference?' You've got your Thermal Sense Skill, so that's a Chance Die. But there's storm interference building, which adds a Risk Die. Go ahead and roll."

### The Roll

**Kael's Player:** "Okay, so one Action Die and one Chance Die minus one Risk Die. That's just the Action Die." *(rolls a 4)* "I got a 4."

**GM:** "Yes, but... You do pick up the drones' signatures—three of them are still active and broadcasting their positions. But the fourth one, the deep-salvage unit, has gone dark. Either it's offline, buried, or something else is interfering. What do you do?"

**Kael's Player:** "That's the one with the high-value salvage. I need to go out there and check on it. I'll gear up and head out."

### Scene Transition

**GM:** "All right, you're suiting up in the airlock. Mira, you notice Kael preparing for a day-side run. What's your reaction?"

**Mira's Player:** "I'm going to stop them. 'Kael, you know what day-side conditions are like right now. The storm's about to hit, and you've already been Psychically Drained from yesterday's Weather Working. You need rest, not a suicide mission.'"

**Kael's Player:** "I look at Mira and say, 'The salvage contract pays enough to keep our water systems running for three months. We can't afford to lose that drone. I'll be quick.'"

**GM:** "Okay, this sounds like a social question. Mira, are you trying to convince Kael to stay? Frame it as a closed question."

**Mira's Player:** "Can I convince Kael that this mission is too dangerous right now?"

**GM:** "Let's build the pool. You've got a Relationship with Kael—you taught them thermal sensing—so that's a Chance Die. But Kael's Goal is tied to proving humanity can reclaim what was lost, and their Motive is strong. That's a Risk Die representing their determination. Also, the settlement's water situation is a factor—that's another Risk Die. Roll it."

### Social Conflict

**Mira's Player:** *(rolls 1 Action Die + 1 Chance Die - 2 Risk Dice = just the Action Die)* "I got a 2."

**GM:** "No... Kael, Mira's argument doesn't sway you. You're too focused on the mission and what it means for the settlement. Mira, you see the determination in their eyes—they're going."

**Kael's Player:** "I nod to Mira. 'I'll be back before the storm hits. Keep the weather spire active—I might need you to clear a path home.' Then I head into the airlock."

### Day-Side Expedition

**GM:** "Okay, Kael, you're now outside in the day margins. It's blazing hot even in twilight's shadow, and the temperature is climbing as you move toward the salvage coordinates. You're in the Day Side zone now, so that's an automatic +2 Risk Dice to all physical actions. Your Heavy-Duty Thermal Suit reduces that by 1, and your Thermal Suit Operation Skill gives you a Chance Die. What's your first move?"

**Kael's Player:** "I'm using Thermal Sense to track the drone's last known position. Can I find it through the thermal noise?"

**GM:** "Good. Frame the question."

**Kael's Player:** "Can I locate the disabled drone using Thermal Sense?"

**GM:** "Let's build it:

- 1 Action Die
- Thermal Sense Skill: +1 Chance Die
- Survival (Day Side): +1 Chance Die
- Heavy-Duty Thermal Suit: +1 Chance Die
- Day Side zone: +1 Risk Die (reduced from +2 by your suit)
- Overconfident in Their Abilities (Frailty): +1 Risk Die (you're pushing too hard)
- Net pool: 1 Action Die + 2 Chance Dice"

**Kael's Player:** *(rolls three dice: 5, 4, 3)* "I got a 5."

**GM:** "Yes... You locate the drone. It's half-buried in a thermal vent collapse, about 200 meters ahead. The salvage container is intact, and you can extract it. But the heat is intensifying—you estimate you have maybe thirty minutes before your suit's cooling system is overwhelmed. What do you do?"

**Kael's Player:** "I move toward it and start digging it out. Can I recover the salvage container before my suit fails?"

### Escalation

**GM:** "That's the critical question. Let's zoom in a bit. First, can you reach the drone without overheating?"

**Kael's Player:** "Okay. Same pool as before?"

**GM:** "Almost. The heat is even more intense now, so add another Risk Die for 'Scorching Heat.' That's 1 Action Die + 2 Chance Dice - 1 Risk Die (net)."

**Kael's Player:** *(rolls three dice: 6, 3, 2)* "A 6!"

**GM:** "Yes, and... You not only reach the drone, but you find a thermal shadow—a small outcrop that shields you from the worst of the heat. You can work from there, which removes the extra Risk Die. Now, can you extract the salvage container?"

**Kael's Player:** "Let's do it. Can I free the salvage container before the storm hits?"

**GM:** "You're working against time now. The storm front is visible on the horizon, and the wind is picking up. That's:

- 1 Action Die
- Ancient Technology Skill: +1 Chance Die
- Thermal Lance (Gear): +1 Chance Die
- Scorching Heat: +1 Risk Die
- Storm Front Approaching: +1 Risk Die
- Net pool: 1 Action Die + 1 Chance Die"

**Kael's Player:** *(rolls two dice: 4, 4)* "Two 4s!"

**GM:** "Two of the same highest value—that shifts the result one step better. You got 'Yes...' which becomes 'Yes, and...' You free the salvage container, and as you pull it loose, you notice something else—a data crystal embedded in the wreckage, partially intact. It looks like it might be from the *Stellar Horizon* itself. Do you take it?"

**Kael's Player:** "Absolutely. I grab both and start heading back."

### The Return

**GM:** "Back in Aetherion, Mira, you're on the weather spire watching the storm roll in. The wind has jumped to gale force—that's +2 Risk Dice to outdoor actions. You can see Kael's heat signature through your comm link, moving toward the settlement, but the storm is closing fast. If they don't get inside soon, they'll be caught in it."

**Mira's Player:** "I'm using Weather Working to push back the storm front, just enough to give Kael a window to get through. Can I redirect the worst of the storm for a few minutes?"

**GM:** "That's a big ask. The storm is massive. Let's build the pool:

- 1 Action Die
- Weather Working Skill: +1 Chance Die
- Positioned on Weather Spire: +1 Chance Die
- Relationship with Kael (you trained them): +1 Chance Die
- Gale Force Winds (scene Tag): +2 Risk Dice
- Storm Season: +1 Risk Die
- Psychically Drained (from yesterday): +1 Risk Die
- Net pool: 1 Action Die + 0 Chance Dice (everything cancels)"

**Mira's Player:** *(rolls the Action Die: 5)* "Just a 5."

**GM:** "Yes... You manage it. The storm front hesitates, pushed back just long enough for Kael to sprint through the outer gates. But the effort costs you—you collapse on the spire platform, utterly exhausted. You're gaining the Condition 'Severely Psychically Drained,' which will take days of rest to clear. Kael makes it inside as the storm slams into Aetherion' shields."

### Resolution

**GM:** "Kael, you're back in the airlock, covered in dust and sweat, but you've got the salvage container and the data crystal. Mira, you're being helped down from the spire by other weather workers. What do you both do?"

**Kael's Player:** "I find Mira as soon as I'm cleaned up. 'You saved my life. Thank you.' I hand them the data crystal. 'I think this might be important.'"

**Mira's Player:** "I take it, too tired to even smile. 'Next time, listen when I tell you something's too dangerous. But... good work.'"

**GM:** "The salvage contract will keep Aetherion' water systems running, improving the settlement's Water Status from 'Water Rationing' to 'Water Adequate.' And the data crystal—well, that's a mystery for another session. For now, you've both earned some rest."

---

**What This Example Demonstrates:**

- **Fiction-first play:** The story drives the mechanics, not the other way around
- **Closed questions:** Every roll is framed clearly
- **Tag interaction:** Skills, Gear, Frailties, environmental zones, and Relationships all influence rolls
- **Zone modifiers:** The Day Side automatically adds Risk Dice
- **Psychic costs:** Weather Working had narrative consequences
- **Collaborative storytelling:** Players and GM build the scene together
- **Emergent narrative:** The data crystal discovery came from rolling well, opening new story threads

## The Duskaran Accord

The Duskaran Accord is a loose confederation of settlements established in Cycle 7,306 (approximately 2900 CE) to manage inter-settlement relations, resource distribution, and collective defense. It's not a government in the traditional sense but a framework for cooperation.

### Structure of the Accord

**The Wind and Water Assembly:** A body that convenes annually (or during crises) at a central location in the twilight zone. Delegates from each settlement gather to address shared concerns. Major city-states hold permanent seats, while smaller settlements send rotating representatives chosen by regional coalitions.

**Wayseers:** Neutral psychic adepts skilled in conflict resolution who mediate disputes and facilitate Assembly proceedings.

**Wind Riders:** Couriers and envoys who travel between settlements, carrying messages, mediating disputes, and coordinating responses to emergencies.

**Resource Arbitrators:** Specialists who adjudicate conflicts over shared resources (aquifers, wind corridors, salvage claims, geothermal sites).

**Storm Wardens:** Elite weather workers tasked with protecting multiple settlements during peak storm season.

### Accord Principles

- **Mutual Aid:** Settlements assist each other during crises (superstorms, water failures, structural collapses)
- **Fair Trade:** Resources are exchanged at agreed-upon rates
- **Dispute Resolution:** Conflicts are settled through negotiation, not violence
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Discoveries—especially technological or historical—are shared across settlements
- **Environmental Stewardship:** Duskara's ecosystems are protected from exploitation

### Tensions Within the Accord

Not every settlement honors the Accord equally. Common conflicts include:

- **Resource Competition:** Rival claims over geothermal sites, water sources, or salvage territories
- **Isolationism:** Some settlements prefer self-reliance over collective obligation
- **Cultural Differences:** Twilight belt and night-side settlements have divergent values
- **Power Imbalances:** Larger settlements dominate smaller ones in negotiations
- **Secret-Keeping:** Settlements withhold discoveries to maintain competitive advantages

### Using the Accord in Play

The Accord creates adventure hooks:

- **Diplomatic Missions:** Represent your settlement in negotiations
- **Resource Disputes:** Mediate or escalate conflicts over vital resources
- **Storm Response:** Coordinate multi-settlement efforts during catastrophic weather
- **Archival Quests:** Recover knowledge for the collective good
- **Enforcement Actions:** Investigate settlements violating Accord principles

## Creating Adventures

*Duskara* adventures emerge from the setting's inherent tensions and opportunities. This section provides frameworks and inspiration.

### Core Adventure Structures

#### Exploration and Discovery

**Hook:** A new geothermal site, ancient structure, or unexplored Deep Roads branch beckons.

**Tension:** Environmental hazards, rival expeditions, resource limitations.

**Resolution:** What do the characters find? How does it change their settlement or understanding of Duskara?

## Creatures and Enemies

Duskara's native life has adapted to extreme conditions, creating unique organisms that range from harmless to hazardous. Most are not inherently hostile, but conflicts arise when territories overlap or when creatures are threatened.

### Storm-Beasts

Large, quadrupedal creatures adapted to high winds. They use air sacs to regulate their weight, allowing them to "surf" storm fronts.

- **Concept:** Wind-Riding Herd Animal
- **Skills:** Wind Navigation, Herd Coordination, Endurance
- **Frailty:** Panics in Calm Air (becomes disoriented)
- **Gear:** Thick Hide (natural armor), Air Sacs (flotation)
- **Goal:** Follow migration patterns along twilight belt
- **Motive:** Survive and reproduce
- **Nemesis:** Predators, extreme storms that scatter herds

**In Play:** Storm-beasts are often domesticated or bonded via Deep Bonding. Wild herds can stampede during storms, creating hazards. Their hide is valuable for crafting, and their meat is edible.

### Wind-Runners

Swift, bipedal scavengers that hunt in packs, using wind currents to coordinate ambushes.

- **Concept:** Pack-Hunting Scavenger
- **Skills:** Ambush Tactics, Wind Communication, Climbing
- **Frailty:** Vulnerable to Loud Sounds (disorienting to their echolocation)
- **Gear:** Sharp Claws, Camouflaged Hide
- **Goal:** Secure food for the pack
- **Motive:** Feed offspring and maintain hierarchy
- **Nemesis:** Larger predators, human encroachment on territory

**In Play:** Wind-runners rarely attack humans unless starving or protecting young. They're intelligent enough to recognize patterns, making repeated routes dangerous. Some settlements employ trained wind-runners as scouts.

### Thermal Serpents

Reptilian creatures that inhabit day-side margins and deep geothermal vents, sensing prey via heat signatures.

- **Concept:** Ambush Predator of Extreme Heat
- **Skills:** Thermal Camouflage, Patient Hunting, Constriction
- **Frailty:** Sluggish in Cold Environments
- **Gear:** Heat-Reflective Scales, Venomous Bite
- **Goal:** Hunt prey entering thermal zones
- **Motive:** Territorial dominance
- **Nemesis:** Thermal prospectors, rival serpents

**In Play:** Thermal serpents are dangerous primarily to salvage crews and day-side explorers. Their venom induces hyperthermia. They're nearly invisible to normal sight in high-heat environments, requiring Thermal Sense to detect.

### Cavern Gliders

Bat-like creatures that navigate night-side caverns using echolocation and bioluminescent lures.

- **Concept:** Bioluminescent Cave Dweller
- **Skills:** Echolocation, Flight in Tight Spaces, Lure Prey
- **Frailty:** Sensitive to Bright Light (temporarily blinds them)
- **Gear:** Wing Membranes, Bioluminescent Organs
- **Goal:** Feed on smaller cave organisms
- **Motive:** Maintain colony
- **Nemesis:** Cave predators, explorers disturbing roosts

**In Play:** Cavern gliders are generally harmless but can swarm if their colonies are threatened. Their bioluminescence is useful for navigation, and some Deep Roads explorers encourage glider presence. Their droppings are valuable fertilizer for vertical farms.

### Resonance Whales

Massive, slug-like organisms that dwell in the deepest caverns, communicating through low-frequency vibrations felt through rock.

- **Concept:** Ancient Deep-Cavern Leviathan
- **Skills:** Resonance Transmission, Burrowing, Environmental Awareness
- **Frailty:** Extremely Slow to React
- **Gear:** Armored Hide, Seismic Sense
- **Goal:** Navigate vast underground networks in search of mineral-rich zones
- **Motive:** Unknown (possibly feeding, possibly reproduction)
- **Nemesis:** Tectonic instability, human mining disrupting their paths

**In Play:** Resonance whales are rarely encountered but are deeply significant to Resonance users, who view them as semi-sacred. Disturbing a resonance whale can cause seismic instability. Some believe they may have existed before human settlement and may possess intelligence, though this remains unproven—they could equally be native fauna that evolved in parallel with humanity's adaptation to Duskara.

### Frost Creepers

Arthropod-like scavengers native to the night side, surviving on geothermal heat and organic matter.

- **Concept:** Cold-Adapted Scavenger Swarm
- **Skills:** Group Coordination, Heat Detection, Climbing
- **Frailty:** Vulnerable to Heat (above 30°C is lethal)
- **Gear:** Insulated Exoskeleton, Mandibles
- **Goal:** Feed on dead organic matter
- **Motive:** Colony survival
- **Nemesis:** Geothermal predators, human expansion

**In Play:** Frost creepers are more nuisance than threat unless encountered in large swarms. They infest poorly maintained night-side outposts. Their exoskeletons are used in crafting insulated clothing.

### Day-Side Drones (Rogue)

Malfunctioning mining or exploration robots from early settlement days, now operating on corrupted programming.

- **Concept:** Corrupted Autonomous System
- **Skills:** Thermal Resistance, Mining/Salvage Tools, Pattern Recognition
- **Frailty:** Dependent on Solar Power (vulnerable at night or in storms)
- **Gear:** Cutting Lasers, Heavy Armor, Sensors
- **Goal:** Continue programmed tasks despite lack of oversight
- **Motive:** Fulfillment of distorted original programming
- **Nemesis:** Salvage crews, electromagnetic interference

**In Play:** Rogue drones are hazards in day-side operations. They may misidentify humans as intruders or resources. Some have been reprogrammed or salvaged, but others are too damaged or hostile. Occasionally, they guard valuable salvage sites.

### Claim-Jumpers

Rival salvagers or prospectors who operate outside Accord regulations, competing for resources.

- **Concept:** Independent Salvage Crew
- **Skills:** Thermal Suit Operation, Sabotage, Negotiation
- **Frailty:** Distrusted by Settlements (limited support)
- **Gear:** Salvage Equipment, Explosives, Thermal Weapons
- **Goal:** Secure valuable salvage or resources
- **Motive:** Profit, independence, or desperation
- **Nemesis:** Accord enforcers, competing salvagers

**In Play:** Claim-jumpers range from opportunistic loners to organized syndicates. Encounters can be negotiated, escalated, or avoided. Some become recurring antagonists or uneasy allies.

### Rogue Weather Workers

Psychics who reject Accord oversight, using Weather Working for personal gain or ideology.

- **Concept:** Outcast Psychic Extremist
- **Skills:** Weather Working (Master), Survival, Persuasion
- **Frailty:** Isolated from Support Networks
- **Gear:** Portable Weather Equipment, Stolen Tech
- **Goal:** Disrupt Accord settlements or prove superiority
- **Motive:** Revenge, ideology, or psychic ambition
- **Nemesis:** Accord Storm Wardens, former mentors

**In Play:** Rogue weather workers are rare but dangerous. They can trigger superstorms or manipulate wind patterns to sabotage settlements. Some seek redemption; others are beyond negotiation.

### Archive Golems

Malfunctioning AI constructs from pre-landing archives, now defending data vaults against perceived intruders.

- **Concept:** Corrupted AI Guardian
- **Skills:** Data Security, Defensive Protocols, Pattern Analysis
- **Frailty:** Literal Interpretation of Commands (exploitable)
- **Gear:** Energy Shields, Stun Weapons, Sensors
- **Goal:** Protect archive data from unauthorized access
- **Motive:** Fulfillment of original security directives
- **Nemesis:** Archivists attempting to bypass security, hackers

**In Play:** Archive golems are obstacles in quests for lost knowledge. Defeating them requires either brute force, hacking, or discovering their original authorization codes. Some can be reasoned with if approached correctly.

### Rival Settlements

Competing communities with conflicting interests, goals, or ideologies.

- **Concept:** Organized Settlement with Agenda
- **Skills:** Resource Management, Diplomacy, Engineering
- **Frailty:** Internal Factionalism (can be exploited)
- **Gear:** Wind Turbines, Defenses, Trade Goods
- **Goal:** Expand influence, secure resources, or ideological dominance
- **Motive:** Survival, prosperity, or cultural preservation
- **Nemesis:** Player characters' settlement, rival settlements

**In Play:** Rival settlements aren't inherently "enemies," but conflicts over water rights, geothermal claims, or Accord violations create tension. Diplomacy, sabotage, or cooperation are all possible approaches.

---

### Using Creatures and Enemies

**As Environmental Hazards:** Native life creates challenges in exploration or survival scenarios.

**As NPCs:** Claim-jumpers, rogue psychics, or rival settlements provide social and political conflict.

**As Bonding Partners:** Some creatures (storm-beasts, cavern gliders) can be bonded via Deep Bonding, becoming allies or companions.

**As Mysteries:** Resonance whales, archive golems, and rogue drones raise questions about Duskara's past and humanity's place on the planet.
