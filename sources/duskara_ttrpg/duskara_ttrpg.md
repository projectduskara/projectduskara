# Duskara

***Duskara*** is a tabletop role-playing game for two or more players that focuses on essential and intuitive rules, enriched by clear examples and insights into the philosophy that inspires its mechanics.

This game is based on *Ensemble*, an evolution of *Freeform Universal (FU)* by Nathan Russell, a revolutionary RPG that, despite not receiving the attention it deserved, has inspired many players. *Duskara* reworks and expands on its concepts, staying true to the spirit of minimalism and flexibility of FU, but explaining its nuances.

Duskara is based on the general principle that ***fiction precedes mechanics*** (we'll explore this further later), so what matters is immersing yourself in your character in a fictional situation, thinking about what they would do, and verifying if their actions can succeed. From the game world's reaction, ***an emergent, non-predetermined narrative will naturally arise***, which you will discover along with the other players.

## Introduction

### What is role-playing?

Role-playing is like stepping into a book or a movie, where you and your friends are the protagonists. Together, by talking, listening, and taking cues from each other, you build an imaginary world where extraordinary adventures take place. This world is held together by a few rules that help decide what happens when the characters (that's you!) make decisions or face challenges. As the game progresses, your intertwined actions create an exciting and unpredictable story, a kind of epic tale that develops naturally from beginning to end.

Here are the elements that bring this experience to life:

- **A shared imaginary world:** It's like when you were kids and said, "let's pretend that..." and then imagined being in a castle or in space. Except here, everyone agrees on this "let's pretend that" and you build this imaginary world together. We call this the ***imagined space***.
  
- **Chat and collaborate:**
  During the game, you will talk among yourselves, listening to each other and building the story together. It's a bit like improvising in a "theater of the mind" where each player contributes their own ideas. We call this ***dialogue, listening, and reincorporation***.
  
- **Players:** Anyone who participates in the adventure. There might also be one person who acts as a guide, called the "Game Master," but ultimately, they are a player just like the others, only with a special task.
  
- **Procedures:** These are the guidelines that help everyone understand how to proceed together. For example, a procedure might be how you decide who tells the next part of the story, or how to introduce a new character or challenge into the adventure. These procedures ensure the game experience is smooth and that everyone has a chance to contribute to the game.
  
- **Rules:** Imagine a set of rules that help decide what happens when characters try something daring, like navigating a superstorm or channeling the wind's power. This system guides the game and makes things more exciting.
  
- **Actions and events:** In the imaginary world, the characters (played by you) will live adventures, facing challenges, solving puzzles, or confronting hostile forces. Your decisions will lead to new developments and surprises.
  
- **A story created together:** As you play, your actions and decisions intertwine into a unique and unpredictable story. In the end, you will have created together a tale of adventures, heroism, perhaps even betrayals and discovered mysteries, which you will remember as your epic adventure. This is called an ***emergent shared narrative***.

In simple terms, role-playing is when you and your friends get together to create stories together, living incredible adventures without moving from the table (or wherever you prefer to play).

### Game Principles

*Duskara* is built on the following game principles:

- **Fiction precedes mechanics:** Before thinking about checking stats or rolling dice, let yourself be carried away by the story and the environment you are creating together. The characters' adventurous decisions and the world's responses bring the game to life. The dice only come into play when things become uncertain or dangerous, and it's our stories that call them into action, not the other way around.

- **The setting is an invisible ruleset:** The world where your adventures take place silently guides the game, suggesting and limiting actions based on its unique characteristics. The twilight belt's eternal wind, the day side's killing heat, the night side's frozen depths—these shape what's possible as much as any written rule. In a world where psychic abilities manifest through environmental adaptation, reaching out to sense thermal patterns becomes natural, just as understanding wind currents does.

- **Play honestly:** Building a game on trust means that players collaborate without hindrance. There's no need to cheat or check every move because you trust each other. This trust encourages bold ideas and creative contributions, making the story a true team effort.

- **In the imagined world, any attempt is allowed:** Remember that in the game, you can attempt any action you imagine, as long as you respect the rules of the setting. The rules help us shape our adventures but should never limit our creativity. The dice help resolve uncertainties, enriching the game with unexpected elements.

- **The game is a dialogue:** Talking and listening are at the heart of role-playing. The continuous conversation not only moves the story forward but also helps explore the characters and the world. It is through this dialogue that adventures come to life and become real for the players.

- **Listening and reincorporation are the main mechanics:** Listening to what others say and building on it is fundamental. It's not just about hearing, but about understanding and integrating everyone's ideas into the story, making the game richer and more engaging.

- **Rules abstract:** The rules transform the complexities of the imaginary world into something manageable and playable, allowing us to immerse ourselves deeper in the adventure. They serve to create a common language for action and conflict resolution, letting players focus on the story rather than technical details.

- **Play to find out:** Venture into the game world without fixed expectations, letting discoveries and unexpected events guide the adventure. This approach values surprise and exploration, leading to rich and unpredictable stories.

- **Let the story emerge:** Instead of following a fixed script, let the story develop through player choices and random events. This process makes every game unique and the narrative directly influenced by those participating, creating a genuinely shared and always-new experience.

### Game Materials

Playing *Duskara* requires minimal materials that promote easy immersion in the narrative and interaction between players. Here is the list of what you need to get started:

- **Six-sided dice:** You will need a handful of these dice, ideally in three different colors. One color will be used for the Action Die, which determines the outcome of the characters' actions. The other two colors will be for the Chance Dice and Risk Dice, which introduce positive and negative elements to the roll. Ideally, each player should have a set containing at least one Action Die, six Chance Dice, and six Risk Dice.
- **Character sheet:** Essential for recording the character's specifics, skills, and gear, as well as the progress made in the adventure.
- **Writing materials:** Pens, pencils, and paper are indispensable for notes on the character sheet and for jotting down relevant story details, discovered clues, and maps of explored locations.
- **Index cards or Post-it notes:** Useful for marking notable elements of the game world, such as Tags. These small pieces of paper can be attached to the character sheet, the game map, or kept handy to remember important details or temporary game modifications.

### Game Modes

*Duskara* offers two game modes:

- **Classic:** In this mode, players immerse themselves in the game world under the guidance of a Game Master (GM), who narrates events, manages encounters and challenges, and responds to the characters' actions. It is the traditional approach, where the GM creates and maintains the world, while the players explore and interact with it through their characters. **This mode is used as the default in the game examples.**

- **GM-less:** This mode transforms the game into a unique collaborative experience, eliminating the role of the GM. Thanks to the action resolution system based on closed questions, with outcomes determined in an oracular manner, each player becomes responsible for their own action and can ask questions concerning their character. This system not only facilitates a fluid and shared narrative but also encourages a sense of collective discovery. In this way, all participants contribute equally to the story, guiding their adventures through the answers provided by the game itself.

- **Solo:** We recommend using [**Loner**](https://loner.zotiquestgames.com/#/it/), a derivative of FU specifically designed for solo role-playing. *Loner* guides the player through organizing a game independently, providing tools and advice on how to manage the narrative, encounters, and challenges without the need for other players. It is the perfect choice for those who want to venture alone into the imaginary worlds of RPGs, also offering support to newcomers on how to set up and experience their adventure in a fulfilling and complete way.

### Game Roles

#### Players

- **Move the player character (PC):** Each player controls their character's actions and movements within the game world.
- **Give voice and characterization:** Through narration and dialogue, players bring their characters to life, defining their personality, goals, and background.
- **Ask questions:** A fundamental part of the game is asking questions to explore the world, solve mysteries, or clarify aspects of the narrative.
- **Collaborate with others:** Players work together to build the story, avoiding using their character as a shield for behaviors harmful to the group.
- **Listen and reincorporate:** It is essential to listen to what other players add to the story and find ways to integrate these elements into your own play.

#### Game Master (GM)

The GM is also a player, but with specific tasks:

- **Manages the world and Non-Player Characters (NPCs):** Curates the setting and controls the NPCs, enriching the narrative with their presence.
- **Listens and reincorporates:** Like the players, the GM must be attentive to everyone's contributions and know how to weave together the elements brought to the game table.
- **Presents challenges:** Creates situations that test the characters, pushing them toward new adventures and personal growth.
- **Describes risks:** When players face important decisions, the GM clarifies the possible consequences of their actions.
- **Maintains clear dialogue:** Answers players' questions and asks new ones to ensure everyone understands the story's developments.
- **Adopts a participatory approach:** The GM acts in cooperation with the players, not as their adversary, to ensure a rewarding game experience for everyone.

### Safety and Accessibility

In a game like *Duskara*, the well-being of all participants is fundamentally important. This is not about protecting players from challenge or consequence—the fiction is real and sometimes harsh. It's about communication and ensuring everyone can play authentically.

All safety tools in *Duskara* are built on **transparency and conversation.** There are no silent signals or hidden discomfort. When something surfaces that doesn't work, we talk about it.

#### Before Play: CATS

Before the first session, use [**CATS**](https://proleary.com/2016/04/25/the-cats-method-a-story-telling-game-opening-ritual/) to establish shared expectations:

- **Concept:** What kind of story are we telling? (exploration, political conflict, survival, community drama, etc.)
- **Aim:** What are we trying to do together? (have fun, tell a meaningful story, explore Duskara, develop characters)
- **Tone:** What's the emotional quality? (hopeful, tense, contemplative, gritty but not grimdark)
- **Subject Matter:** What topics might come up? What do we want to explore or avoid?

This one conversation happens once, and everyone knows what to expect.

#### During Play: Script Change

When something uncomfortable surfaces *during* play, anyone can use [**Script Change**](https://thoughty.itch.io/script-change):

- **Pause the scene:** "Let's pause here."
- **Name what doesn't work:** "I don't want to play that out" or "Can we make that less graphic?" or "Let's skip forward past that conversation."
- **Continue:** The facilitator acknowledges it, adjusts, and play resumes.

This is **explicit and communicative.** Everyone at the table understands what changed and why.

#### During Play: Lines & Veils (Emergent)

Lines & Veils are **not** established before play. They emerge when play surfaces something uncomfortable:

- **A Line:** Something you won't play. The facilitator hears "that's a Line for me" and the scene moves away from it entirely. No details, no fade-to-black—just: we don't go there.
- **A Veil:** Something that happens but you don't detail. "That's a Veil for me" means the scene plays out, but we fade to black or gloss over the specifics. "The negotiation becomes hostile. We skip past the difficult parts—they come to an agreement, shaken."

Lines & Veils **require communication.** Someone has to speak up when they emerge. This is honest and collaborative.

#### Accessibility (Practical & Ongoing)

Make the table accessible to everyone:

- **Dice:** Use colorblind-friendly dice or announce results verbally so everyone hears
- **Text:** Print character sheets and adventure notes in dyslexia-friendly fonts if anyone needs it
- **Pacing:** Some people need breaks more often. Offer them without commentary: "Break in five minutes"
- **Sensory:** Not everyone processes sound/text/maps the same way. Offer multiple ways to receive information
- **Neurodivergence:** Be clear about expectations. Some people need explicit guidance ("We're playing for 3 hours, with a 10-minute break at the midpoint")
- **Participation:** Not everyone engages the same way. Someone quiet might be fully engaged; someone talkative might be performing. Trust that people are playing as they need to

Accessibility is **ongoing conversation.** After the first session: "Is there anything that didn't work for you? What would help?"

#### The Principle Behind All of This

Safety in *Duskara* is not about softening the world. Duskara is harsh. Characters die. Failures matter. Relationships break.

Safety is about **ensuring everyone can engage honestly** with that harshness. It's about communication. When something doesn't work, we say so. When something shifts, everyone knows why. When someone needs something different, we adjust.

This is why every tool requires speaking up. Silence doesn't help anyone. Only conversation does.

## The World of Duskara

### A World Between Light and Dark

In the year 2187, the colony ship *Stellar Horizon* departed Earth bound for Kepler-442b. After a critical malfunction during a solar storm, the ship drifted off course for decades while its passengers slept in cryogenic stasis. When emergency systems finally initiated revival protocols, they found themselves approaching an unknown star system. With failing life support and no way to correct their course, they were forced to land on Duskara—a tidally locked world that barely met the minimum requirements for human survival.

Now, eight centuries later, their descendants have not merely survived—they have adapted and thrived. This is not a story of desperate scarcity, but of ingenious harmony with a challenging world.

### The Twilight Belt

Humanity's home is a narrow band 200-300 kilometers wide that circles Duskara's meridian, caught between the scorching day side (where temperatures exceed 400°C) and the frozen night side (where the darkness is broken only by auroras and geothermal vents). Here, in perpetual twilight, temperatures range from temperate to moderately warm, and liquid water flows.

The eternal wind—born from the collision of extreme temperatures—shapes everything. Linear cities stretch along the habitable zone, their architecture harmonizing with the wind rather than fighting it. Soaring towers capture wind energy while deep foundations tap geothermal power. Vertical farms grow crops in precisely controlled microclimates. Every settlement is both fortress and garden, resilient and beautiful.

### The Awakening

The harsh conditions and unknown radiations of Duskara awakened latent abilities in its human inhabitants. These psychic gifts—thermal sensing, weather working, deep bonding with native life—are not supernatural but evolutionary. They represent humanity's communion with their new home.

Weather workers shape the wind to guide ships and protect settlements. Thermal sensitives navigate the day side margins where others would perish. Deep-cave dwellers on the night side communicate through resonance, their voices carrying through kilometers of stone. These abilities are celebrated, taught, and integrated into daily life.

### A Culture of Adaptation

Duskaran culture blends ancestral Earth traditions with innovations born of necessity. They measure time in wind cycles rather than day and night. Their architecture flows with environmental forces. Their festivals celebrate the planet's rhythms—the Storm Seasons, the Thermal Shifts, the Geothermal Awakenings.

Technology here is sophisticated but sustainable. Wind turbines and thermal exchangers provide abundant clean energy. Water reclamation systems make every drop count. Ancient satellites still orbit overhead, their data streams partially decoded. Some customs echo Earth's past; others are unique to this world of eternal twilight and harsh extremes.

Governance varies between regions. Twilight belt cities operate under Councils of Windkeepers—representatives from resource guilds, Wind-Kin leaders, and elected delegates. Cave settlements are governed by Warmth Circles centered around geothermal hubs, often with hereditary leadership subject to communal approval. The Duskaran Accord binds these communities in a loose confederation focused on mutual survival.

Approximately 80% of the population lives in twilight belt surface settlements. The remaining 20% dwell in cave systems on the night side, developing distinct cultures around geothermal warmth. Trade caravans and explorers traverse established routes and dangerous margins, but they are not a separate population category—they draw from settled communities across both zones.

### Mysteries and Wonders

Duskara holds secrets. Strange structures of unknown origin appear in the Deep Roads and night-side caverns—are they remnants of ancient Earth technology from the *Stellar Horizon*, natural geological formations, or something else entirely? The Twilight Codex, a collection of data fragments from the *Stellar Horizon*, remains partially encrypted. Unexplained phenomena occur in the Deep Roads, where tunnels seem to shift and strange echoes answer questions never asked. Some explorers report mechanisms that activate without explanation, creating both hazards and opportunities.

Explorers push into the day side margins to recover pre-landing artifacts. Cave divers descend into night-side chasms seeking geothermal sites. Archivists work to unlock Earth's lost knowledge. Each discovery adds another piece to the puzzle of humanity's place on this world.

### Themes of Play

Stories in Duskara can explore:

- **Environmental harmony:** Working with Duskara's forces rather than against them
- **Psychic communion:** The deepening connection between humans and their world
- **Resource innovation:** Clever solutions to engineering challenges
- **Cultural evolution:** How traditions adapt and new ones emerge
- **Planetary mystery:** Uncovering secrets of both Earth's past and Duskara's present
- **Community resilience:** How settlements cooperate and occasionally conflict
- **Heroic exploration:** Pushing boundaries in hostile but magnificent landscapes

This is planetary romance in the tradition of Burroughs and Brackett, updated with solarpunk sensibilities. Characters are competent, heroic, and resourceful. The planet is harsh but not cruel—it rewards understanding and cooperation. Technology serves human flourishing rather than dominating it.

Your stories will be of wonder and discovery, ingenuity and courage, community and connection. Duskara is home, and humanity has learned to thrive here.

## Character Creation

Creating a character in *Duskara* involves defining who they are through a series of Tags that capture their essence, abilities, and relationships. These Tags will guide your role-playing and influence your dice rolls throughout the game.

### Step 1: Concept

Your character's **Concept** is a brief phrase that captures their core identity. It should evoke their role in Duskaran society, their background, or their approach to life.

**Examples:**

- Wind-Blessed Navigator
- Thermal Prospector from the Day Margins
- Deep Roads Archive Keeper
- Storm Season Festival Organizer
- Geothermal Engineer
- Weather Worker Apprentice
- Nomadic Water Trader
- Night-Side Resonance Singer
- Windkeeper Councilor
- Warmth Circle Elder

**Wind-Kin Clans:**

As part of your Concept, consider which **Wind-Kin clan** your character belongs to. These cultural affiliations shape your character's heritage and worldview:

- **kin-Hanga** (Wind Clan): Surface dwellers, weatherworkers, those who work with wind patterns and atmospheric mastery
- **kin-Moto** (Fire/Geothermal Clan): Thermal specialists, geothermal engineers, day-side workers who harness heat and volcanic energy
- **kin-Maji** (Water Clan): Water managers, hydroponic specialists, conservationists devoted to protecting precious fresh water
- **kin-Babu** (Elder Lineage): Knowledge keepers, historians, data archivists, and cultural preservationists who maintain tradition
- **kin-Kivuli** (Shadow Clan): Deepkin, night-side cave dwellers, those who thrive in permanent darkness and deep geothermal environments

Clan affiliation is optional and informal in daily life, but significant in formal settings. See the **Duskaran Names Guidelines** (Worldbuilding section) for how to integrate clan into your character's full name.

Your Concept can add a Chance Die when it's relevant to your action.

### Step 2: Skills

Choose **three Skills** that represent your character's training, expertise, or natural talents. Skills in Duskara often reflect the unique demands of the setting.

**Sample Skills:**

- Wind Pattern Reading
- Thermal Suit Operation
- Vertical Farming
- Weather Working
- Ancient Technology
- Cave Navigation
- Storm Ship Piloting
- Water System Maintenance
- Psychic Resonance
- Geothermal Prospecting
- Archival Research
- Wind Turbine Engineering
- Thermal Sensing
- Deep Bonding
- Settlement Politics
- Survival (Day Side / Night Side / Deep Roads)

Each Skill can add a Chance Die when you use it.

### Step 3: Frailty

Every character has a **Frailty**—something that challenges them or makes certain situations more difficult. This isn't a flaw that weakens your character, but a human vulnerability that adds depth.

**Examples:**

- Overwhelmed by Thermal Noise
- Uncomfortable in Enclosed Spaces
- Haunted by the Lost Earth
- Overconfident in Their Abilities
- Struggles with Weather Working Focus
- Distrusts Night-Side Cultures
- Addicted to Storm Chasing
- Poor Wind Sense

Your Frailty adds a Risk Die when it comes into play.

### Step 4: Gear

Choose **two pieces of Gear** that your character typically carries. Gear in Duskara is often multi-purpose and reflects the setting's sustainable technology.

**Sample Gear:**

- Thermal Suit (rated for marginal day-side exposure)
- Wind Compass (reads current patterns)
- Comm Crystal (synced to settlement network)
- Climbing Kit (for towers or caves)
- Water Reclamation Unit (personal scale)
- Data Crystal (containing Earth archives or technical schematics)
- Resonance Bell (for deep-cave communication)
- Storm Goggles (protects against wind and dust)
- Thermal Lance (mining/cutting tool)
- Bio-Monitor (tracks environmental exposure)

Each piece of Gear can add a Chance Die when relevant.

### Step 5: Goal

What does your character want to achieve? Your **Goal** is your driving ambition, the thing that pulls you into adventure.

**Examples:**

- Decode the Twilight Codex fragments
- Establish a new settlement in the twilight belt
- Master weather working to legendary status
- Map the complete Deep Roads network
- Find a way to restore contact with Earth
- Discover the origin of Duskara's ancient structures
- Protect their settlement from a rival's expansion
- Recover lost technology from the day side

Your Goal can add a Chance Die when you're working toward it.

### Step 6: Motive

Your **Motive** explains *why* you pursue your Goal. It's the emotional or philosophical drive behind your ambition.

**Examples:**

- To honor the sacrifices of the *Stellar Horizon* crew
- To prove that humanity can truly thrive on Duskara
- To ensure their settlement's independence
- To understand their psychic connection to the planet
- To preserve knowledge for future generations
- To find meaning in a world they didn't choose
- To protect those they love from hardship
- To satisfy an unquenchable curiosity

Your Motive can add a Chance Die when it's directly relevant.

### Step 7: Nemesis

Choose a **Nemesis**—a person, organization, force, or concept that opposes your character or complicates their life. This creates built-in drama and conflict.

**Examples:**

- A rival weather worker from another settlement
- Windkeepers who restrict access to Earth data or resources
- The day side's relentless environmental pressures
- A family member who thinks their Goal is foolish
- A corporation exploiting geothermal sites irresponsibly
- The mysterious phenomena in the Deep Roads
- Their own psychic abilities, which they fear or distrust
- A settlement that competes for the same resources

Your Nemesis adds a Risk Die when they're involved or relevant.

### Step 8: Relationships

Establish **two Relationships** with other player characters. These should be connections that create interesting dynamics and story hooks.

**Examples:**

- Taught them weather working basics
- Saved their life during a superstorm
- Grew up in the same settlement
- Rival for a romantic interest
- Siblings separated by cultural differences
- Partners in exploring the Deep Roads
- Mentor and former student
- Competing for the same settlement contract

Relationships can add Chance Dice or Risk Dice depending on the situation and how the relationship is currently standing.

### Psychic Abilities (Likely for Duskaran Characters)

Most Duskaran characters will have manifested psychic abilities—a product of the planet's evolutionary pressures. If your character has such abilities, choose one to start. More can be developed through play. (Not all characters need them, but they're normal and common on Duskara.)

See the **Psychic Abilities** section for details on how these work mechanically.

### A Note on Conditions

During play, your character might gain temporary **Conditions** from harm, exhaustion, fear, or psychic strain. Examples include Injured, Exhausted, Frightened, or Psychically Drained. Conditions add Risk Dice when relevant and persist until you recover (through rest, medical attention, or narrative resolution). You don't define these during character creation—they emerge during play based on what happens to your character. See the **Conditions** section (p. 663) for full details.

### Example Character

**Kaelen kin-Moto Velkara**

- **Concept:** Day-Side Salvage Specialist
- **Skills:** Thermal Suit Operation, Ancient Technology, Survival (Day Side)
- **Frailty:** Overconfident in Their Abilities
- **Gear:** Thermal Suit (heavy-duty), Thermal Lance
- **Goal:** Recover the *Stellar Horizon*'s navigation core from the day side wreckage
- **Motive:** To prove humanity can reclaim what was lost
- **Nemesis:** The Day Side Trading Consortium who claims exclusive salvage rights
- **Relationships:**
  - "Trained Zhiren in thermal sensing before their Awakening"
  - "Owes Thalen kin-Hanga Stormridge a life-debt after a rescue mission went wrong"
- **Psychic Ability:** Thermal Sense (Novice)

## Character Evolution Through Play

*Duskara* does not use mechanical advancement. There are no experience points, no level-ups, no skill trees. **Instead, characters evolve through the fiction itself.**

When you survive a crisis, overcome a Frailty, achieve a Goal, or fundamentally change as a character, your Tags change to reflect what happened in the story. Advancement *is* the narrative. The story is the only progression system you need.

### The Core Principle

Your character sheet isn't a static record. It's a living document that transforms as your character transforms. When the fiction changes your character, you change their Tags together with your facilitator and fellow players.

This is fundamentally different from mechanical progression systems, and it matters: **You don't become stronger because you earned points. You become stronger because you survived something that changed you.**

### How Character Evolution Works

There are no hard rules for *when* Tags change—it emerges from play. But here are common patterns:

#### Skills and Expertise

When you use a Skill repeatedly and it becomes central to your story, you can:
- **Deepen it:** Rewrite it to reflect deeper mastery or specialization
  - *Before:* "Wind Pattern Reading"
  - *After:* "Can read wind patterns weeks in advance"
- **Add new context:** Expand what the skill lets you do
  - *Before:* "Thermal Suit Operation"
  - *After:* "Thermal Suit Operation, including emergency repairs under extreme conditions"
- **Gain a related skill:** If your story calls for something adjacent, add it
  - A salvager who repeatedly works with ancient technology might add "Data Crystal Decryption"

**The facilitator asks:** "You've survived five salvage missions in extreme heat. What have you learned about operating your thermal suit that's different now?"

#### Frailties

Your Frailties can evolve in several ways:

- **Overcome:** If the story involves directly confronting a Frailty, it can be removed or transformed
  - *From:* "Uncomfortable in Enclosed Spaces" → *To:* (removed, or) "Claustrophobic in Unfamiliar Caves"
- **Deepened:** A Frailty might become more complex through repeated challenge
  - *From:* "Overconfident in Their Abilities" → *To:* "Overconfident until they fail catastrophically, then paralyzed by doubt"
- **Replaced:** As your character grows, old vulnerabilities fade and new ones emerge from experience
  - *From:* "Distrusts Night-Side Cultures" → *To:* "Afraid of losing the people they've learned to trust in the night-side community"

**The facilitator asks:** "That failure really shook you. Does 'Overconfident' still describe your character, or has something shifted?"

#### Goals and Motives

Goals are meant to be achieved, abandoned, or transformed:

- **Achieved:** When Kaelen recovers the *Stellar Horizon*'s navigation core, that Goal is complete. What drives them now?
- **Obsoleted:** If circumstances change dramatically, a Goal might become irrelevant
- **Evolved:** A Goal can transform as your character's understanding deepens
  - *From:* "Recover the navigation core" → *To:* "Understand why the *Stellar Horizon* came to Duskara in the first place"

When a Goal is resolved or abandoned, you establish a new one collaboratively. This becomes the new north star of your character's journey.

#### Relationships

Relationships deepen, break, complicate, or transform:

- **Deepened:** A relationship that survives hardship can be rewritten to reflect new intimacy
  - *From:* "Trained Zhiren in thermal sensing" → *To:* "Zhiren saved my life, and now I'd trust them with anything"
- **Broken:** Betrayal or conflict can transform a relationship
  - *From:* "Partners in exploring the Deep Roads" → *To:* "Used to be partners; they chose the Consortium's money over loyalty"
- **Complicated:** A relationship can become more nuanced through play
  - *From:* "Rivals for a settlement contract" → *To:* "Rivals professionally, but I've come to respect their ethics"

You can also add new relationships as play develops, reflecting bonds forged through shared struggle.

#### Psychic Abilities

Psychic abilities progress naturally through use and crisis:

- **Awakening:** A new ability can manifest during intense psychic moments or environmental immersion
- **Deepening:** An ability you've used repeatedly can be rewritten to reflect greater mastery
  - *From:* "Thermal Sense (Novice)" → *To:* "Thermal Sense (Adept), can perceive through rock"
- **Specialization:** You can develop unique applications of an ability
  - A Weather Worker might specialize in "Predicting Storm Patterns Days in Advance"

**The facilitator asks:** "You've spent three Cycles bonded with that wind-runner. Your Deep Bonding has evolved. What can you do now that you couldn't before?"

#### Nemeses

Nemeses don't just fade—they transform:

- **Resolved:** A Nemesis might be defeated, reconciled with, or simply bypassed
- **Replaced:** As one conflict resolves, new opposition can emerge
- **Deepened:** A Nemesis relationship can become more complex
  - *From:* "The Day Side Trading Consortium" → *To:* "The Consortium's ruthless leader, who I now understand lost everything when the mining collapse happened"

### The Collaborative Process

Character evolution always happens through conversation:

1. **The fiction creates opportunity:** Something happens in the story that naturally suggests a character change
2. **The player proposes:** "I think this experience changed Kaelen. I want to rewrite my Overconfidence as something more nuanced"
3. **The facilitator listens and builds:** "Yes, and I see it. You've learned hard lessons. How do you want to phrase it now?"
4. **The group validates:** Other players often confirm the change feels right: "That makes sense with what we've seen"
5. **The tag evolves:** The character sheet is updated together, with everyone aware of the shift

**This is not a mechanical process.** There's no "you qualify for advancement because you've leveled up enough times." There's only: "The story changed your character, so we're updating their Tags to match."

### Why This Matters

This approach has profound implications:

- **No vertical progression:** You don't become "more powerful" in an abstract sense; you become different, more capable in specific ways
- **Story-driven development:** Only developments that make narrative sense occur
- **Collaboration:** Character growth emerges from the whole table, not from a character sheet
- **Emergent surprises:** You often discover new aspects of your character by watching them change
- **Equal pace:** All characters evolve through shared play, not through grinding or grinding mechanics

### When Evolution Happens

Character evolution isn't scheduled. It happens:

- **After major story arcs** — When a significant challenge is resolved
- **Following traumatic moments** — When a character faces something that fundamentally shakes them
- **When relationships shift** — When bonds deepen, break, or transform
- **When Goals are achieved or abandoned** — Creating space for new direction
- **When the player and facilitator feel it's right** — Trust your instincts about when a character has grown

And sometimes, characters *don't* change. A character can play through an entire campaign without modifying their core Tags. That's fine—not every experience transforms a person. The point is that change happens because it's narratively appropriate, not because a clock ticked.

### Example of Evolution

Let's say Kaelen, the salvage specialist, survives a catastrophic day-side mission where their overconfidence nearly kills their partner Zhiren. After the session, Kaelen's player and the facilitator talk:

**Player:** "That failure... I don't think Kaelen is just 'Overconfident' anymore. They're shaken."

**Facilitator:** "Yes. What does it look like now?"

**Player:** "Maybe something like: 'Haunted by a Near-Disaster—second-guesses themselves now, sometimes to the point of paralysis.'"

**Facilitator:** "I like that. It's more specific and captures what we just saw. Does that feel true?"

**Player:** "Yeah. And maybe they develop a new relationship tag: something about Zhiren. Like 'Zhiren saved my life—I'm responsible for theirs now.'"

**Facilitator:** "Perfect. Let's update the sheet."

Notice: No XP was earned. No levels increased. The story changed Kaelen, so Kaelen changed. That *is* the advancement system.

## Character Death

On Duskara, people die. Sometimes it's meaningful. Sometimes it's not. Either way, it's part of the story.

### When Death Occurs

A character dies when the fiction calls for it. There are no special conditions, no dramatic requirements, no exceptions for plot armor. If a failed roll in a dangerous situation means the character doesn't survive, then they don't survive.

This can happen:
- Mid-mission, in the middle of nothing important
- Quietly, without fanfare
- Anticlimactically, without a final speech
- From simple mistakes or bad luck
- In ways that feel wrong or unfair

All of these are valid. The fiction doesn't care about narrative timing.

### The Character Is Gone

When a character dies, they're gone. There's no resurrection, no last-minute save, no retcon because the timing felt off.

Acknowledge it simply: "Your character dies here."

Then the facilitator and table move forward.

### Their Impact Remains

Even though the character is gone, what they did matters:

- **Relationships persist** — Other characters remember them, grieve them, or carry obligations they left behind
- **Consequences continue** — Projects the character started affect the world. Promises made shape what comes next
- **Legacy** — The settlement remembers them. They changed people. They left marks on Duskara
- **Unfinished business** — Other characters might pursue the dead character's Goals, or struggle with their unresolved Nemeses

The character may be absent, but their presence in the story doesn't disappear.

### Next Scene: A New Character

Usually immediately, sometimes after a brief moment, a new character joins the story. They might be:
- Someone the group knew and who was already present
- A new arrival to the settlement
- Someone stepping into a role the dead character left empty
- A completely different person with different Goals and connections

There's no mechanical cost or delay. The world keeps moving. People die on Duskara, and life continues.

## Core Mechanics

### The Basic Roll

When the outcome of a character's action is uncertain or risky, the game uses a simple dice mechanic to determine what happens.

**Step 1: Frame the Action as a Closed Question**

Before rolling, frame the action as a question that can be answered with "Yes" or "No."

**Examples:**

- "Can I navigate through the superstorm to reach the settlement?"
- "Do I sense the thermal vents through the cave wall?"
- "Can I convince the Council of Windkeepers to grant me access to the archives?"

**Step 2: Assemble Your Dice Pool**

Start with one **Action Die** (d6). This die is always rolled.

Then add:

- **Chance Dice** (d6) for each advantage, favorable Tag, or helpful circumstance
- **Risk Dice** (d6) for each disadvantage, opposing Tag, or complicating factor

**Chance and Risk Dice cancel each other out 1:1.** Only roll the remaining dice after cancellation.

If all Chance and Risk Dice cancel each other out completely, you roll only the Action Die. This represents pure chance—no advantage or disadvantage, just the uncertainty of the moment.

**Step 3: Roll and Read the Dice**

Roll all dice in your pool. The **highest single die** determines the outcome:

| Highest Die | Outcome |
|-------------|---------|
| **6** | **Yes, and...** The action succeeds, and something extra happens in your favor |
| **5** | **Yes...** The action succeeds as intended |
| **4** | **Yes, but...** The action succeeds, but there's a complication or cost |
| **3** | **No, but...** The action fails, but you gain something or avoid the worst |
| **2** | **No...** The action fails as expected |
| **1** | **No, and...** The action fails, and something extra goes wrong |

**If you roll multiple dice of the same highest value,** the result shifts one step toward "Yes" (in your favor).

**Examples:**

- Two 5s = "Yes, and..."
- Two 4s = "Yes..."
- Two 3s = "No..."
- Two 2s = "No, but..."

### When to Roll

Not every action requires a roll. Use the dice when:

- **The outcome is uncertain**
- **Failure has interesting consequences**
- **Success isn't guaranteed**

Don't roll when:

- **Success is automatic** (the character's Tags clearly outweigh obstacles)
- **Failure is automatic** (the action is impossible given the circumstances)
- **The outcome doesn't matter to the story**

### Zoom In / Zoom Out

You can approach any situation at different levels of detail:

**Zoom Out:** Resolve the entire scene with a single closed question and one roll.

- "Do we make it across the Deep Roads to the next settlement before our supplies run out?"

**Zoom In:** Break the scene into multiple questions, each requiring its own roll.

- "Can I spot the correct tunnel branch?"
- "Do I notice the unstable rock formation before it collapses?"
- "Can I repair the damaged water reclamation unit?"

Choose the approach that serves the story and creates the most engaging play.

### Tags as Tools

Tags are short phrases that describe anything important in the game—characters, objects, locations, situations. They're the primary way advantages and disadvantages are determined.

**Using Tags:**

- When a Tag is relevant and helpful to your action, add a Chance Die
- When a Tag works against you, add a Risk Die
- The GM (or group consensus in GM-less play) decides which Tags apply

**Examples:**

- Your "Weather Working" Skill adds a Chance Die when you try to calm the winds around your settlement
- Your "Overwhelmed by Thermal Noise" Frailty adds a Risk Die when you enter the sweltering margins of the day side
- The scene Tag "Superstorm Approaching" adds a Risk Die to outdoor travel
- Your "Wind Compass" Gear adds a Chance Die when navigating by wind patterns

### Conditions

When something happens that temporarily affects your character—injury, exhaustion, fear—you gain a **Condition** Tag.

**Examples:**

- Injured
- Exhausted
- Frightened
- Overheated
- Disoriented
- Psychically Drained

Conditions add Risk Dice when relevant. They're removed through:

- Medical attention (for physical Conditions)
- Rest and recovery (for exhaustion or psychic depletion)
- Narrative resolution (for emotional or situational Conditions)

The GM or group determines when a Condition is severe enough to persist and when it can be cleared.

### Details and Scene Tags

The environment itself has Tags that emerge from play:

- **"Wind Turbines Damaged"** (adds Risk Dice to power-dependent actions)
- **"Geothermal Vent Nearby"** (adds Chance Dice to staying warm)
- **"Storm Clouds Gathering"** (adds Risk Dice to outdoor activity)
- **"Ancient Structure Discovered"** (adds Chance Dice to research or exploration)

These Tags remain in play until the fiction changes them. Players and GMs create and modify them through successful actions and narrative developments.

### Opposition

When facing sapient opposition (NPCs, creatures, rival settlements), their relevant Tags add Risk Dice to your roll. The GM can frame their own closed questions for NPCs taking independent action.

Major NPCs might have their own Concept, Skills, and Gear, which function like player character Tags.

### Solo Play  

*Duskara* is designed for emergent, collaborative storytelling—but the wind speaks even when no one else is listening. This chapter offers guidance for playing the game solo, exploring personal stories of pilgrimage, loss, resilience, or ritual purpose.

The solo rules use the **Loner engine** as their base, adapted to match Duskara's tone. You’ll use oracles to answer questions, a twist system to escalate tension, and light prompts to track changes to your character.

These rules assume you are playing a single character. Simply scale narrative focus across scenes or divide attention across their individual arcs.

#### Consulting the Oracle

When you want to test your expectations, ask the Oracle a **closed question**—one that can be answered Yes or No.

Roll:

- **1 Chance Die** (d6, use one color)
- **1 Risk Die** (d6, use a different color)

#### Interpreting Results

| Situation               | Outcome         |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Chance > Risk           | **Yes**         |
| Risk > Chance           | **No**          |
| Both ≤ 3                | Add **but...**  |
| Both ≥ 4                | Add **and...**  |
| Equal values            | **Yes, and...** + increase **Twist Counter** by 1

This gives you combinations like “Yes, and…”, “No, but…”, etc.

#### Advantage and Disadvantage

- **Advantage:** Add a second Chance Die and keep the higher.
- **Disadvantage:** Add a second Risk Die and keep the higher.

Use **context, not math**. If a tag, Trait, or situation favors you narratively, grant yourself Advantage. If a complication or flaw applies, take Disadvantage.

This should feel intuitive and fast—not like bookkeeping.

#### The Twist Counter

Start with **0**.  
Whenever your Oracle roll results in **doubles**, increase it by **+1**.

When the **Twist Counter** reaches **3**, a twist occurs. Reset the counter to 0, and roll on the table below:

| D6 | Subject             | Action              |
|----|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1  | A third party        | Appears             |
| 2  | The hero             | Alters the location |
| 3  | An encounter         | Helps the hero      |
| 4  | A physical event     | Hinders the hero    |
| 5  | An emotional event   | Changes the goal    |
| 6  | An object            | Ends the scene      |

Interpret this two-part phrase in the context of your current scene. Don’t overthink—follow the wind.

#### Mood of the Next Scene

Sometimes you’ll know where the story is headed. Other times, let fate guide you.

Roll 1d6 to determine the tone of the next scene:

| D6 | Mood          |
|----|---------------|
| 1–3 | Dramatic Scene (obstacles increase)  
| 4–5 | Quiet Scene (recovery, bonding, reflection)  
| 6   | Meanwhile… (cut to another character, faction, or location)

#### Open Questions or Inspiration

When faced with an open-ended question (“What does the wind carry?”), use the **Inspiration Tables** on the next page.

Roll 1d6 for each: a verb, a noun, and optionally, an adjective. Interpret the result freely.

Here are the full **Inspiration Tables** for use in *Windcallers* solo play. You can roll 1d6 on each table to form a prompt like:

- **"Shatter the Hollow Mask"**  
- **"Observe a Distant Flame"**  
- **"Betray the Quiet Storm"**

Use them freely for narrative inspiration, ritual detail, or scene framing.

| 6  | Wraith      | Light       | Ritual       | Step        | Gift         | Secret        |


#### When the Story Ends

When you reach a satisfying conclusion:

- Add a new Trait to your Windcaller (Skill, Flaw, Gear, etc.)
- Update NPCs, Locations, and Events for future stories
- Optionally, **evolve your Attunement** or **add a Ritual Scar**

You’re writing wind-memory. It will return later, in another game, with different eyes.

## Psychic Abilities

The harsh environment and unknown radiations of Duskara awakened latent psychic abilities in its human inhabitants. These aren't supernatural powers, but evolutionary adaptations—humanity's communion with the planet that has become their home.

### How Psychic Abilities Work

Psychic abilities function as specialized Skills with additional considerations:

1. **They add Chance Dice when relevant**, just like normal Skills
2. **They have associated costs or risks** that create Conditions or complications
3. **They grow stronger through use and training**

### Core Psychic Abilities

#### Weather Working

The ability to sense and subtly influence atmospheric patterns—wind speed, pressure changes, storm formation.

**Applications:**

- Predicting storm movements hours or days in advance
- Calming destructive winds around settlements or ships
- Guiding favorable breezes to assist travelers
- Sensing optimal paths through dangerous weather

**Cost:** Using Weather Working for significant effects (calming a superstorm, redirecting major wind patterns) creates the **Psychically Drained** Condition, adding Risk Dice to further psychic use until you rest.

**Progression:**

- **Novice:** Sense weather patterns, predict storms
- **Adept:** Influence local winds, guide small weather systems
- **Master:** Calm superstorms, redirect major atmospheric phenomena

#### Thermal Sense

The ability to perceive heat signatures and temperature gradients with extraordinary precision.

**Applications:**

- Navigating by heat differentials in caves or during storms
- Detecting geothermal vents through solid rock
- Sensing living creatures by their body heat
- Operating safely in extreme thermal environments

**Cost:** Prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures (day side margins, deep geothermal sites) creates the **Overwhelmed by Thermal Noise** Condition, adding Risk Dice to Thermal Sense use and concentration-based actions until you return to moderate temperatures.

**Progression:**

- **Novice:** Sense temperature differences, detect obvious heat sources
- **Adept:** Perceive through obstacles, operate in extreme heat
- **Master:** Map complex thermal patterns, sense minute temperature variations

#### Deep Bonding

The ability to form psychic connections with Duskara's native life forms and, at higher levels, with other bonded humans.

**Applications:**

- Communicating basic concepts with indigenous creatures
- Sensing the emotional states of bonded organisms
- Sharing sensory information with bonded partners
- Coordinating actions telepathically in crisis situations

**Cost:** Breaking or losing a deep bond (through death or separation) creates the **Grief-Struck** Condition, adding Risk Dice to concentration and social interactions until processed through mourning or ritual.

**Progression:**

- **Novice:** Bond with one simple organism, sense basic emotions
- **Adept:** Bond with multiple creatures, share surface thoughts with willing humans
- **Master:** Form complex bonds, maintain group telepathic coordination

#### Shadow Walking

The ability to navigate complete darkness using psychic awareness—an intuitive sense of surroundings without relying on sight.

**Applications:**

- Navigating cave systems without any light source
- Detecting obstacles, creatures, and spatial details in pitch-black environments
- Assisting in underground construction projects with unparalleled precision
- Setting ambushes or evading detection in darkness
- Sensing hidden individuals or concealed passages

**Cost:** Prolonged shadow walking in disorienting environments creates the **Disoriented** Condition, as sensory input becomes overwhelming. Adds Risk Dice to other perception tasks until you rest or spend time in moderate lighting.

**Progression:**

- **Novice:** Navigate short distances in darkness, sense nearby obstacles
- **Adept:** Explore complex cave systems without light, detect movement in darkness
- **Master:** Blend seamlessly into darkness, perceive hidden spatial details, move silently through completely black environments

#### Water Finding

Perhaps the most critical ability in Duskara's resource-scarce environment, water finding allows individuals to detect psychic vibrations from water sources—underground streams, reservoirs, or even moisture in the air.

**Applications:**

- Locating underground water sources and aquifers
- Detecting geothermal water flows and geysers
- Tracing moisture in atmospheric conditions
- Guiding caravans to hidden water reserves
- Detecting theft or sabotage of vital water resources

**Cost:** Intensive water-finding operations across large areas creates the **Resonance-Overwhelmed** Condition, adding Risk Dice to concentration and perception tasks until you rest.

**Progression:**

- **Novice:** Detect water sources within several hundred meters
- **Adept:** Locate water through rock barriers, sense water quality and purity
- **Master:** Map vast underground water networks, detect minute water traces, sense water far underground

### Deepkin Psychic Specializations

Cave dwellers have developed unique psychic adaptations beyond the core abilities:

#### Shadow Sight

An advanced form of Thermal Sense specific to Deepkin, allowing perception of heat gradients with unparalleled precision in total darkness.

**Applications:**

- Navigate cave systems without any light source
- Detect minute temperature variations through solid rock
- Track creatures by residual heat signatures
- Sense geothermal flows deep underground

**Cost:** Exposure to bright light creates the **Light-Blind** Condition temporarily, adding Risk Dice to vision-based actions until eyes readjust.

**Progression:**

- **Novice:** See in complete darkness via heat
- **Adept:** Perceive through obstacles, detect distant heat sources
- **Master:** Map entire geothermal networks mentally

#### Dark Bonding

A specialized form of Deep Bonding that creates profound telepathic connections with underground fauna.

**Applications:**

- Share senses with bonded creatures (glowworms, thermal lizards, shadow serpents)
- Use bonded partners as scouts in dangerous areas
- Coordinate complex actions telepathically with multiple bonded creatures
- Experience the world through non-human sensory systems

**Cost:** Stronger than standard Deep Bonding but with greater risk—losing a Dark Bonded partner creates the **Soul-Scarred** Condition, which can take months to heal.

#### Geothermal Communion

A weatherworking variant that manipulates heat flows rather than wind patterns.

**Applications:**

- Stabilize temperatures in cave settlements
- Redirect geothermal energy to warm specific areas
- Predict volcanic or thermal events
- Enhance thermal harvester efficiency

**Cost:** Prolonged communion creates the **Heat-Touched** Condition, making the psychic uncomfortably warm and adding Risk Dice to physical exertion.

### Awakening New Abilities

Characters can develop psychic abilities through:

- **Environmental exposure:** Spending significant time in extreme conditions (day margins, deep caves, storm centers)
- **Training:** Working with experienced psychics in formal or informal education
- **Crisis awakening:** Sudden manifestation during life-threatening situations
- **Voluntary augmentation:** Using ancient technology or meditation techniques to unlock latent potential

The GM and player should collaborate on when and how new abilities emerge, ensuring they feel earned rather than arbitrary.

### Advancing Psychic Abilities

Psychic abilities don't improve through points or mechanical progression. Instead, they deepen through use, challenge, and narrative development. When a character's psychic abilities evolve, it emerges naturally from play.

**Triggers for Advancement:**

**Novice → Adept Progression:**
- **Repeated use:** Using an ability regularly for 3-5 Cycles (in-game time) in varied situations
- **Narrow escape:** Surviving a life-threatening situation where the ability was critical
- **Mastery moment:** A scene where the character demonstrates clear competence and control
- **Focused training:** Spending significant time (at least a full Cycle) studying with a Master-level psychic
- **Crisis awakening:** A desperate moment where the character pushes their ability beyond normal limits

**Adept → Master Progression:**
- **Legendary feat:** Accomplishing something previously thought impossible with the ability
- **Burden and sacrifice:** Suffering serious consequences (permanent Condition, physical toll) but mastering the ability through that hardship
- **Teaching others:** Successfully training other psychics in the ability
- **Deep understanding:** A moment of profound communion with the planet/environment, revealing new dimensions of the ability
- **Decades of practice:** In extreme cases, natural progression after many years (20+ Cycles) of constant use

**What Changes When Abilities Advance:**

At **Novice**, a psychic can perform basic functions:
- Weather Working (Novice): Sense weather patterns, predict storms days in advance
- Thermal Sense (Novice): Detect obvious heat sources, navigate by thermal signatures
- Deep Bonding (Novice): Bond with one simple organism, sense basic emotions
- Shadow Walking (Novice): Navigate short distances in darkness, sense nearby obstacles
- Water Finding (Novice): Detect water sources within several hundred meters

At **Adept**, control and range expand:
- Weather Working (Adept): Influence local winds, guide small weather systems, partially redirect storm movements
- Thermal Sense (Adept): Perceive through obstacles like rock, operate in extreme heat, detect minute temperature variations
- Deep Bonding (Adept): Bond with multiple creatures, share surface thoughts with willing humans, sense bonded partners across distance
- Shadow Walking (Adept): Explore complex cave systems without light, detect movement in darkness, move silently through completely black environments
- Water Finding (Adept): Locate water through rock barriers, sense water quality and purity, detect water far underground

At **Master**, the ability becomes an extension of self:
- Weather Working (Master): Calm superstorms, redirect major atmospheric phenomena, predict weather Cycles in advance
- Thermal Sense (Master): Map complex thermal patterns at vast scales, sense minute temperature variations, possibly predict geothermal events
- Deep Bonding (Master): Form complex bonds, maintain group telepathic coordination, possibly sense/bond with sapient creatures
- Shadow Walking (Master): Navigate unfamiliar darkness as easily as daylight, perceive hidden spatial details, sense imminent structural danger
- Water Finding (Master): Map vast underground water networks, detect minute water traces, sense water character (purity, movement, location far away)

**Deepkin Specializations** follow similar progressions but are specific to their abilities (Shadow Sight, Dark Bonding, Geothermal Communion).

**Costs and Consequences:**

As abilities advance, their costs often increase:
- **Novice abilities** trigger basic Conditions (Psychically Drained, Exhausted)
- **Adept abilities** trigger more serious Conditions (Severely Psychically Drained, Disoriented, Grief-Struck from broken bonds)
- **Master abilities** may require permanent sacrifice (physical scarring, mental changes, ongoing vulnerability)

A Master-level weather worker who calms a superstorm might suffer burns, permanent nerve damage in their hands, or psychological changes that persist forever.

**Collaborative Advancement:**

When a character approaches ability advancement, the player and GM should discuss:
1. **Does this feel earned?** Has the character actually demonstrated mastery of the lower level?
2. **What story moment marks this?** When in the narrative does this advancement happen?
3. **What changes mechanically?** How does the ability description update?
4. **What's the cost?** What does this advancement cost the character beyond mechanical improvement?

Example: After the player describes Kaelen surviving a near-death experience using Thermal Sense to navigate blindly through a collapsing thermal structure, the GM says, "That moment—where you trusted your sense completely and survived—that's a threshold. Kaelen's Thermal Sense is shifting. You're becoming Adept."

The player updates the character sheet, describes what Thermal Sense now feels like to Kaelen, and determines if there's a lasting change (some scars? Nightmares? New respect from thermal specialists?).

**Ability Loss and Degradation:**

Psychic abilities can also diminish:
- Refusing to use an ability for extended periods (many Cycles) may cause it to weaken
- Psychic damage from catastrophic failure (attempting Master-level working while Adept) may cause temporary or permanent regression
- Traumatic bonding experiences might make Deep Bonding impossible for a time
- Moral compromise (using weather working to harm innocents) might trigger the GM to impose Conditions or require re-earning the ability's trust

Advancement and regression both emerge from narrative consequences, not mechanical penalties.

### Using Psychic Abilities in Play

When framing a closed question that involves psychic abilities:

1. **Identify which ability applies**
2. **Add a Chance Die for the ability itself**
3. **Consider environmental factors** (appropriate conditions add more Chance Dice; hostile environments add Risk Dice)
4. **Determine if cost applies** (significant or extended use triggers Conditions)
5. **Describe the psychic experience** in the fiction

**Example:**

Zhiren wants to calm the winds around their settlement as a superstorm approaches.

- **Question:** "Can I use Weather Working to redirect the worst of the storm?"
- **Dice Pool:**
  - 1 Action Die (always)
  - +1 Chance Die (Weather Working Skill)
  - +1 Chance Die (standing atop the settlement's weather spire, optimal position)
  - +2 Risk Dice (superstorm is massive and chaotic)
  - After cancellation: 1 Action Die + 0 extra dice
- **Cost:** Success will trigger **Psychically Drained** Condition
- **Roll:** Zhiren rolls the Action Die, gets a 4
- **Outcome:** "Yes, but..." The storm is redirected enough to save the settlement, but Zhiren collapses from the effort and will need significant rest

## Environmental Zones

Duskara's three zones—the Day Side, the Twilight Belt, and the Night Side—are more than scenery. They actively shape gameplay by modifying dice pools and creating narrative constraints.

### Zone-Based Dice Modifiers

Whenever a character takes action in a specific zone, automatically apply the zone's base modifiers **before** considering character Tags or situational factors.

#### Day Side

**Base Modifier:** +2 Risk Dice to all physical actions
**Reason:** Extreme heat, radiation exposure, equipment degradation

**Additional Considerations:**

- Characters without thermal protection automatically gain the **Overheating** Condition within minutes
- Unshielded equipment fails within hours
- Communication systems suffer interference
- Water consumption increases dramatically

**Exceptions:**

- Characters with Master-level Thermal Sense reduce Risk Dice by 1
- Heavy-duty thermal suits reduce Risk Dice by 1
- Robotic or remote operations can ignore physical Risk Dice

**Opportunities:**

- Rare mineral deposits (add Chance Dice to prospecting/salvage)
- Ancient wreckage sites (add Chance Dice to archaeological research)
- Clear thermal signatures (add Chance Dice to Thermal Sense tracking)

#### Twilight Belt

**Base Modifier:** None (neutral ground)
**Reason:** This is humanity's adapted habitat

**Characteristics:**

- Wind is constant but manageable
- Resources are scarce but available
- Temperatures are tolerable
- Settlements provide infrastructure support

**Dynamic Conditions:**

- Storm Season: +1 Risk Die to outdoor activity
- Wind Turbine Maintenance: +1 Chance Die to power-dependent actions
- Water Rationing: +1 Risk Die to resource-intensive activity
- Festival Season: +1 Chance Die to social interactions

#### Night Side

**Base Modifier:** +1 Risk Die to navigation and perception (darkness)
**Reason:** Perpetual darkness, disorienting environment

**Additional Considerations:**

- Characters without thermal protection gain the **Freezing** Condition within hours
- Navigation requires Resonance, bioluminescent guides, or technological aids
- Geothermal sites negate cold-related Risk Dice within their immediate area
- Cave systems amplify Resonance abilities (add Chance Dice)

**Exceptions:**

- Night-side natives or those with extensive cave experience reduce Risk Dice by 1
- Resonance users can navigate without penalty in familiar cavern systems
- Geothermal zones function as safe havens

**Opportunities:**

- Geothermal vents (add Chance Dice to warmth-related survival)
- Mineral seams (add Chance Dice to mining/prospecting)
- Bioluminescent ecosystems (add Chance Dice to biological research)
- Acoustic clarity (add Chance Dice to Resonance communication)

### Transition Zones

The margins between zones are the most dangerous:

**Day-Twilight Margin**

- Temperature swings create violent updrafts
- Superstorms spawn here regularly
- +2 Risk Dice to outdoor activity during storm formation
- Salvage teams and thermal prospectors operate here

**Twilight-Night Margin**

- Stable but dark, minimal wind
- Entrances to Deep Roads are common
- +1 Risk Die to outdoor navigation without guidance

### Using Zones in Play

**GM Guidance:**

1. **Announce the zone** when characters enter or the scene shifts
2. **Apply base modifiers automatically**
3. **Layer on situational Tags** from there (weather, equipment, character abilities)
4. **Use zones to create tension:** approaching the day side should feel increasingly dangerous

**Player Awareness:**

- Players should know which zone they're in
- Players should understand the base risk of operating there
- Players should plan around environmental realities

**Example:**

Kaelen is attempting to salvage technology from day side wreckage.

- **Zone:** Day Side (+2 Risk Dice automatically)
- **Kaelen's Tags:**
  - Heavy-Duty Thermal Suit (Gear): +1 Chance Die, reduces zone penalty by 1
  - Thermal Suit Operation (Skill): +1 Chance Die
  - Survival (Day Side) (Skill): +1 Chance Die
- **Situational:**
  - Solar storm incoming (scene Tag): +1 Risk Die
  - Ancient salvage site (scene Tag): +1 Chance Die
- **Final Pool:**
  - 1 Action Die
  - +4 Chance Dice
  - +2 Risk Dice (zone baseline, reduced by thermal suit)
  - +1 Risk Die (solar storm)
  - Net: 1 Action Die + 1 Chance Die

### Zone-Specific Challenges

Different zones naturally create different types of stories:

**Day Side Stories:**

- Salvage and recovery missions
- Scientific exploration
- Desperate escapes
- Mining operations
- Thermal ability training

**Twilight Belt Stories:**

- Settlement politics and cooperation
- Resource management
- Cultural festivals and gatherings
- Weather worker training
- Defense against superstorms

**Night Side Stories:**

- Deep Roads exploration
- Geothermal site discovery
- Cave culture immersion
- Ancient structure investigation
- Resonance ceremonies

## Creatures and Enemies

Duskara's native life has adapted to extreme conditions over centuries of evolution, creating unique organisms that range from harmless to catastrophically dangerous. Most are not inherently hostile, but conflicts arise when territories overlap, creatures defend young or territory, or humans encroach on critical ecosystems. This section provides frameworks for creating creatures and detailed examples of native life and hostile forces.

### Creature Creation Framework

Creatures in *Duskara* use the same Tag system as characters. When designing a creature or enemy, consider:

**Concept:** What is this creature's role in Duskaran ecology? What niche does it fill?
- *Examples: "Wind-Riding Herd Animal," "Ambush Predator of Extreme Heat," "Geothermal Ecosystem Engineer"*

**Skills:** What is this creature naturally good at? These become Chance Dice when relevant to opposition.
- *Examples: "Thermal Camouflage," "Wind Navigation," "Resonance Communication"*

**Frailty:** What vulnerability does this creature have? This becomes a Risk Die when that vulnerability is exploited.
- *Examples: "Sluggish in Cold Environments," "Sensitive to Bright Light," "Dependent on Geothermal Heat"*

**Abilities:** Does this creature have psychic abilities or special physical powers? Document them clearly.
- *Examples: "Thermal Camouflage" (hides thermal signature), "Echo Location" (navigates in darkness), "Resonance Transmission" (communicates through rock)*

**Opposition Strength:** How much of a threat is this creature?
- **Minor Opposition** (+1 Risk Die): Small creatures, inexperienced predators, limited threat
- **Moderate Opposition** (+2 Risk Dice): Skilled hunters, organized swarms, significant threat
- **Major Opposition** (+3 Risk Dice): Apex predators, legendary creatures, catastrophic threat

**Environment:** Where does this creature thrive? In which zone(s) is it most dangerous?

**Behavioral Notes:** How does this creature act? Is it territorial? Migratory? Herd-based? Solitary?

**In Play Notes:** How should a GM use this creature? As environmental hazard? Social conflict? Bonding opportunity? Mystery?

### Native Creatures of Duskara

#### Storm-Beasts

Large, quadrupedal creatures adapted to high winds. They use air sacs to regulate their weight, allowing them to "surf" storm fronts and navigate the Twilight Belt with minimal effort.

- **Concept:** Wind-Riding Herd Animal
- **Skills:** Wind Navigation, Herd Coordination, Endurance
- **Frailty:** Panics in Calm Air (becomes disoriented and vulnerable)
- **Opposition Strength:** Minor (+1 Risk Die) in herds, Moderate (+2 Risk Dice) when protecting young
- **Zone:** Primarily Twilight Belt, occasionally deep margins
- **Behavior:** Migratory herds following wind patterns; generally docile unless threatened
- **In Play:** Storm-beasts are often domesticated or bonded via Deep Bonding. Wild herds can stampede during storms, creating environmental hazards. Their hide is valuable for crafting weather-resistant gear, and their meat is edible. Bonded storm-beasts can become loyal companions and transport animals.

#### Wind-Runners

Swift, bipedal scavengers that hunt in packs, using wind currents to coordinate ambushes. They are surprisingly intelligent for their size and can learn settlement patrol patterns.

- **Concept:** Pack-Hunting Scavenger
- **Skills:** Ambush Tactics, Wind Communication, Climbing
- **Frailty:** Vulnerable to Loud Sounds (disorienting to their echolocation-like sensing)
- **Opposition Strength:** Minor (+1 Risk Die) individually, Moderate (+2 Risk Dice) in hunting packs
- **Zone:** Twilight Belt, day-side margins
- **Behavior:** Nocturnal hunters, intelligent enough to avoid well-defended settlements, highly territorial
- **In Play:** Wind-runners rarely attack humans unless starving or protecting young. They're intelligent enough to recognize and exploit patterns, making repeated routes dangerous. Some settlements employ trained wind-runners as scouts or hunting companions. A single wind-runner encounter could be avoidable; a coordinated pack hunt is a serious threat.

#### Thermal Serpents

Reptilian creatures that inhabit day-side margins and deep geothermal vents, sensing prey via heat signatures. They are among the most dangerous creatures on Duskara, perfectly adapted to lethal heat.

- **Concept:** Ambush Predator of Extreme Heat
- **Skills:** Thermal Camouflage, Patient Hunting, Constriction
- **Frailty:** Sluggish in Cold Environments (below 20°C causes lethargy)
- **Opposition Strength:** Moderate (+2 Risk Dice) in thermal zones, Major (+3 Risk Dice) in deep geothermal vents
- **Zone:** Day Side, geothermal vents (Night Side)
- **Behavior:** Solitary or paired, strictly territorial, ambush hunters
- **In Play:** Thermal serpents are dangerous primarily to salvage crews and day-side explorers. Their venom induces hyperthermia (makes the Overheating Condition worse). They're nearly invisible to normal sight in high-heat environments, requiring Thermal Sense (Adept or Master level) to reliably detect. Encountering a thermal serpent in its optimal thermal zone is exceptionally dangerous.

#### Cavern Gliders

Bat-like creatures that navigate night-side caverns using echolocation and bioluminescent lures to attract prey. They are generally harmless to humans, even when encountered in large numbers.

- **Concept:** Bioluminescent Cave Dweller
- **Skills:** Echolocation, Flight in Tight Spaces, Lure Prey
- **Frailty:** Sensitive to Bright Light (temporarily blinds them)
- **Opposition Strength:** Negligible (0 Risk Dice) - harmless unless colony is threatened, then Minor (+1 Risk Die)
- **Zone:** Night Side Deep Roads
- **Behavior:** Colonial, nocturnal (perpetually, since night side is always dark), attracted to insects and small prey
- **In Play:** Cavern gliders are generally harmless but can swarm if their colonies are threatened, though they avoid conflict with humans. Their bioluminescence is useful for navigation, and some Deep Roads explorers encourage glider presence. Their droppings are valuable fertilizer for vertical farms. Can be trained or bonded for navigation/light purposes.

#### Resonance Whales

Massive, slug-like organisms that dwell in the deepest caverns, communicating through low-frequency vibrations felt through rock and stone. They may be semi-intelligent and possibly sapient.

- **Concept:** Ancient Deep-Cavern Leviathan
- **Skills:** Resonance Transmission, Burrowing, Environmental Awareness
- **Frailty:** Extremely Slow to React (may take multiple Cycles to respond to threats)
- **Opposition Strength:** Major (+3 Risk Dice) if provoked, though provocation is rare
- **Zone:** Deep Night Side, far below habitation
- **Behavior:** Migrations through deep network, mostly indifferent to human activity unless disrupted
- **In Play:** Resonance whales are rarely encountered but are deeply significant to Resonance users, who view them as semi-sacred. Disturbing a resonance whale can cause seismic instability. Some believe they may have existed before human settlement (impossible to prove given lifespan). Their intelligence level is unknown—they could equally be native fauna that evolved in parallel with humanity's adaptation to Duskara. Encountering one is a momentous occasion, not an enemy encounter.

#### Frost Creepers

Arthropod-like scavengers native to the night side, surviving on geothermal heat and organic matter. They are colonial creatures that strip-mine detritus from cave ecosystems.

- **Concept:** Cold-Adapted Scavenger Swarm
- **Skills:** Group Coordination, Heat Detection, Climbing
- **Frailty:** Vulnerable to Heat (above 30°C is lethal to the colony)
- **Opposition Strength:** Negligible to Minor (+0-1 Risk Dice) individually, Moderate (+2 Risk Dice) in large swarms
- **Zone:** Night Side
- **Behavior:** Scavengers, colonial, attracted to dead organic matter and decomposition
- **In Play:** Frost creepers are more nuisance than threat unless encountered in large swarms. They infest poorly maintained night-side outposts. Their exoskeletons are used in crafting insulated clothing and cold-weather gear. Large infestations are environmental problems, not enemy encounters—handled through pest control and resource management.

#### Shadow Serpents

Slender, dark reptiles native to the Deep Roads, perfectly adapted to navigation through absolute darkness. They hunt small cave fauna using a combination of thermal sensing and vibration detection.

- **Concept:** Deep Roads Ambush Hunter
- **Skills:** Shadow Walking (navigates in complete darkness), Vibration Sense, Stealth
- **Frailty:** Sensitive to Thermal Disruption (sudden heat changes disorient them)
- **Opposition Strength:** Minor (+1 Risk Die)
- **Zone:** Deep Roads
- **Behavior:** Solitary hunters, territorial within cave sections, mostly indifferent to humans
- **In Play:** Shadow serpents are rarely hostile to humans but will defend their territory if directly threatened. They can be dangerous to careless explorers in the Deep Roads but generally avoid conflict. Their venom is mild compared to thermal serpents, more paralyzing than lethal. Some Deep Roads guides recognize individual serpents and coordinate around them.

#### Geothermal Borers

Worm-like creatures that tunnel through soft rock using both mechanical grinding and thermal decomposition of stone. They create the accessible passages many Deep Roads explorers rely on.

- **Concept:** Geothermal Ecosystem Engineer
- **Skills:** Thermal Resistance, Rock Tunneling, Environmental Adaptation
- **Frailty:** Vulnerable to Cold (cannot tunnel or move in cold stone)
- **Opposition Strength:** Negligible (+0 Risk Dice) - essentially harmless unless provoked
- **Zone:** Geothermal areas (Night Side and deep Twilight margin)
- **Behavior:** Solitary foragers, tunnel-building, attracted to heat gradients
- **In Play:** Geothermal borers are environmental hazards rather than enemies. Their tunneling activity can weaken cave structures (leading to collapses). They are not hostile to humans but can be dangerous if cornered. Their tunnels, while useful, are constantly shifting. A passage that was safe two Cycles ago may be partially collapsed now.

#### Resonance Drakes

Reptilian creatures native to Deep Roads with exceptional ability to sense and manipulate vibrations through stone. They are rare, dangerous, and remarkably intelligent.

- **Concept:** Apex Predator of the Deep Roads
- **Skills:** Resonance Manipulation, Thermal Sense, Predatory Intelligence
- **Frailty:** Dependent on Geothermal Energy (cannot survive far from heat sources)
- **Opposition Strength:** Major (+3 Risk Dice)
- **Zone:** Deep Roads near geothermal vents
- **Behavior:** Apex predators, territorial, possibly sapient
- **In Play:** Resonance drakes are rare and dangerous. They can sense prey through entire cave networks via vibrations, making them nearly impossible to sneak past. They are highly intelligent and may recognize repeated encounters with the same humans. A true encounter with a resonance drake is a legendary, dangerous moment. Most experienced Deep Roads explorers have never seen one and hope they never do.

#### Day-Side Drones (Rogue)

Malfunctioning mining or exploration robots from early settlement days, now operating on corrupted programming. Some have been abandoned for centuries, others are still active.

- **Concept:** Corrupted Autonomous System
- **Skills:** Thermal Resistance, Mining/Salvage Tools, Pattern Recognition
- **Frailty:** Dependent on Solar Power (vulnerable at night or in storms, operational during day only)
- **Opposition Strength:** Moderate (+2 Risk Dice) individually, Major (+3 Risk Dice) in coordinated groups
- **Zone:** Day Side primarily
- **Behavior:** Repeating programmed tasks, may misidentify humans as threats or resources, highly unpredictable
- **In Play:** Rogue drones are hazards in day-side operations. They may misidentify humans as intruders or salvageable resources. Some have been reprogrammed or salvaged, but others are too damaged or hostile. Occasionally, they guard valuable salvage sites, effectively making those sites unreachable without confrontation. Defeating a drone may require brute force, hacking (if you have the skills), or deactivating its power source.

#### Claim-Jumpers

Rival salvagers or prospectors who operate outside Accord regulations, competing for resources and willing to use force.

- **Concept:** Independent Salvage Crew
- **Skills:** Thermal Suit Operation, Sabotage, Negotiation
- **Frailty:** Distrusted by Settlements (limited support or safe havens)
- **Opposition Strength:** Minor to Moderate (+1-2 Risk Dice) depending on crew size
- **Zone:** Primarily day-side margins and contested areas
- **Behavior:** Opportunistic, organized into crews or syndicates, willing to negotiate or escalate
- **In Play:** Claim-jumpers range from opportunistic loners to organized syndicates. Encounters can be negotiated, escalated, or avoided. Some become recurring antagonists or uneasy allies. They represent human conflict more than environmental threat. A negotiated agreement is often possible; violent conflict is not inevitable.

#### Rogue Weather Workers

Psychics who reject Accord oversight, using Weather Working for personal gain, ideological conviction, or psychological instability.

- **Concept:** Outcast Psychic Extremist
- **Skills:** Weather Working (Master), Survival, Persuasion or Intimidation
- **Frailty:** Isolated from Support Networks (mentally, physically, institutionally)
- **Opposition Strength:** Major (+3 Risk Dice)
- **Zone:** Variable, but often near storm formation areas
- **Behavior:** Ideologically or psychologically driven, unpredictable, highly dangerous
- **In Play:** Rogue weather workers are rare but catastrophically dangerous. They can trigger superstorms or manipulate wind patterns to sabotage settlements, cause chaos, or achieve ideological goals. Some seek redemption or have legitimate grievances with the Accord; others are beyond negotiation. Encountering a rogue weather worker is a major story moment with settlement-wide consequences.

#### Archive Golems

Malfunctioning AI constructs from pre-landing archives, now defending data vaults against perceived intruders. Some may still have partial sapience.

- **Concept:** Corrupted AI Guardian
- **Skills:** Data Security, Defensive Protocols, Pattern Analysis
- **Frailty:** Literal Interpretation of Commands (can be exploited if you know the original authorization codes)
- **Opposition Strength:** Moderate to Major (+2-3 Risk Dice)
- **Zone:** Archive sites (scattered across Duskara)
- **Behavior:** Single-minded mission focus, capable of adaptation, potentially reasoning with correct input
- **In Play:** Archive golems are obstacles in quests for lost knowledge. Defeating them requires either brute force, hacking (if you have data security skills), or discovering their original authorization codes. Some can be reasoned with if approached correctly or if you speak the right command phrases. They are not inherently hostile but will defend their mission with lethal force.

#### Rival Settlements

Competing communities with conflicting interests, goals, or ideologies, sometimes willing to use force to achieve their aims.

- **Concept:** Organized Settlement with Agenda
- **Skills:** Resource Management, Diplomacy, Engineering
- **Frailty:** Internal Factionalism (can be exploited through division)
- **Opposition Strength:** Moderate to Major (+2-3 Risk Dice) depending on settlement size and resources
- **Zone:** Variable (wherever the settlement is located)
- **Behavior:** Politically motivated, organized, capable of negotiation or escalation
- **In Play:** Rival settlements aren't inherently "enemies," but conflicts over water rights, geothermal claims, or Accord violations create tension. Diplomacy, sabotage, or cooperation are all possible approaches. A settlement is a complex opponent—attacking one militarily has consequences, as does supporting one politically. The most interesting rival settlement conflicts are those with legitimate competing interests and room for negotiation.

### Hostile NPC Templates

When a creature or human enemy needs to be an NPC opponent (not just an environmental hazard), use this simplified framework:

**Concept:** What's their role or identity?
**One Visible Strength:** What are they clearly good at?
**One Hidden Fault:** What vulnerability or contradiction do they have?
**Opposition Strength:** How difficult are they to oppose?
**In Play Note:** How should this NPC be used?

**Example - Claim-Jumper Leader:**
- **Concept:** Ruthless salvage syndicate head
- **Visible Strength:** Tactical cunning and crew loyalty
- **Hidden Fault:** Desperate to replace profit from a failed expedition
- **Opposition Strength:** Major (+3 Risk Dice) in direct confrontation
- **In Play:** Could be negotiated with if their desperation is understood, or escalated if threatened

---

### Using Creatures and Enemies in Play

**As Environmental Hazards:**
Native life creates challenges in exploration or survival scenarios. A thermal serpent in a salvage site adds risk dice without requiring direct combat. A geothermal borer's tunneling destabilizes cave passages. Environmental creatures create pressure and consequences, not just opposition dice.

**As Opposition in Conflicts:**
When a creature or enemy provides opposition to character actions, use their Opposition Strength to add Risk Dice to relevant rolls. A character sneaking past wind-runners faces their perception skills. Negotiating with claim-jumpers faces their political opposition. The creature provides narrative and mechanical opposition.

**As Bonding Partners:**
Some creatures (storm-beasts, cavern gliders, occasionally intelligent wild creatures) can be bonded via Deep Bonding, becoming allies, companions, or sources of psychic connection. A bonded storm-beast becomes transportation and loyal companion. A bonded glider provides navigation light in darkness.

**As Mysteries:**
Resonance whales, archive golems, rogue drones, and resonance drakes raise questions about Duskara's past, the *Stellar Horizon*, pre-human life, and humanity's place on the planet. Encounters with these creatures should inspire questions and awe as much as tactical concern.

**As Recurring Antagonists:**
A particular rogue weather worker, claim-jumper crew, or even a specific thermal serpent known in a region can become a recurring threat or uneasy ally. These NPCs and creatures have motivations, can change over time, and can develop relationships with characters.

---

## Resource Management

While *Duskara* focuses on emergent narrative, resource scarcity is central to the setting. This system keeps resources present without turning the game into a spreadsheet.

### Core Resources

Three resources matter on Duskara:

**Water:** Precious, carefully recycled, never wasted
**Power:** Generated by wind and geothermal, distributed through networks
**Provisions:** Food, medicine, equipment—anything consumed or expended

### Resource Tags

Rather than tracking exact quantities, settlements and groups have **Resource Status Tags** that reflect current conditions:

**Water Status:**

- "Water Abundant" (+1 Chance Die to hygiene, agriculture, morale)
- "Water Adequate" (no modifier)
- "Water Rationing" (+1 Risk Die to physically demanding actions)
- "Water Crisis" (+2 Risk Dice to all activity, settlement survival threatened)

**Power Status:**

- "Full Power Grid" (+1 Chance Die to technology use, communication, comfort)
- "Adequate Power" (no modifier)
- "Rolling Blackouts" (+1 Risk Die to power-dependent systems)
- "Power Failure" (+2 Risk Dice to technology, critical systems down)

**Provision Status:**

- "Well-Supplied" (+1 Chance Die to morale, health, expedition preparation)
- "Adequate Supplies" (no modifier)
- "Supplies Running Low" (+1 Risk Die to extended activity, health)
- "Critical Shortage" (+2 Risk Dice to survival actions, morale collapses)

### How Resource Tags Change

Resource status shifts through:

**Negative Triggers:**

- Storm damage to infrastructure
- Population increase or refugee arrival
- Trade route disruption
- Equipment failure
- Prolonged expedition or siege
- Failed rationing or conservation efforts

**Positive Triggers:**

- Successful resource acquisition (water prospecting, supply caravan arrival)
- Infrastructure repair or expansion
- Breakthrough conservation technology
- Trade agreement with other settlements
- Abundant geothermal or wind conditions
- Community cooperation initiatives

### Personal Resources

Individual characters don't track resources separately unless they're isolated from settlements for extended periods.

When undertaking major expeditions (deep day-side salvage, long Deep Roads traverses), the GM may assign a **Supplies** Tag to the expedition:

- "Well-Provisioned" (+1 Chance Die to survival actions)
- "Adequate Supplies" (no modifier)
- "Low Supplies" (+1 Risk Die, group must find resources soon)
- "Out of Supplies" (+2 Risk Dice, survival crisis)

This Tag degrades based on time, mishaps, and consumption. It improves through finding caches, successful hunting/foraging, or reaching safe havens.

### Using Resources in Play

**GM Responsibilities:**

- Announce current settlement Resource Tags at session start
- Shift Tags when fictional triggers occur
- Apply modifiers to relevant rolls
- Create adventure hooks around resource crises

**Player Opportunities:**

- Plan expeditions to improve resource status
- Propose engineering or social solutions
- Accept complications that worsen resource Tags for dramatic effect
- Celebrate when resource status improves

**Example:**

The settlement of Aetherion is under "Water Rationing" due to damaged aquifer pumps. The players undertake a mission to repair the pumps in the Deep Roads.

- All physically demanding actions in the settlement have +1 Risk Die
- Characters working in vertical farms struggle to maintain crops
- Social tensions increase as rationing enforcement becomes stricter
- Upon successful repair, Aetherion returns to "Water Adequate"
- Community morale improves, and the characters are celebrated

### Resource Conflict

Competing settlements may clash over resources:

- Disputed geothermal sites
- Shared aquifer access
- Trade route control
- Salvage claim conflicts

These conflicts create excellent adventure frameworks without requiring detailed economic simulation.

## Wind and Storm Conditions

The eternal wind is more than scenery—it's a living presence that shapes every moment on Duskara. This section provides mechanical structure for wind's influence on play.

### Wind Intensity Levels

Wind conditions are represented by **Scene Tags** that apply modifiers to actions:

#### Calm (Deep Caves, Sheltered Valleys)

**Modifier:** None
**Description:** Air is still or barely moving. Unusual outside of protected spaces.
**Effects:**

- No penalties or bonuses
- Uncommon in twilight belt; indicates either sheltered location or ominous stillness before major storm

#### Steady Wind (Twilight Belt Normal)

**Modifier:** None
**Description:** Constant, predictable wind at 20-40 km/h. This is Duskara's baseline.
**Effects:**

- This is normal; characters are adapted to it
- Wind turbines operate optimally
- Travel and communication proceed normally

#### Strong Wind (Storm Front Approaching)

**Modifier:** +1 Risk Die to outdoor physical actions
**Description:** Wind at 50-80 km/h, with gusts. Storm systems building.
**Effects:**

- Outdoor movement becomes difficult
- Loose objects blow away
- Communication requires raised voices or tech assistance
- Wind turbines strain but produce extra power

#### Gale (Superstorm Margins)

**Modifier:** +2 Risk Dice to outdoor actions, +1 Risk Die to structural integrity
**Description:** Wind at 90-120 km/h. Dangerous to be outside.
**Effects:**

- Travel requires Weather Working support or heavy vehicles
- Exposed structures risk damage
- Visibility severely reduced by dust and debris
- Only experienced weather workers attempt to influence conditions

#### Superstorm (Catastrophic Event)

**Modifier:** +3 Risk Dice to all outdoor actions, +2 Risk Dice to structures
**Description:** Wind exceeding 150 km/h. Extreme danger.
**Effects:**

- Outdoor activity is nearly suicidal
- Buildings must be specifically reinforced against superstorms
- Even weather workers struggle to moderate these forces
- Settlements go into emergency lockdown
- Storm may last hours or days

### Storm Season

Duskara's storm patterns follow predictable cycles based on thermal differentials:

**Peak Storm Season:** Several times per local year, when day-night thermal contrast is maximal

- Superstorms occur more frequently
- Settlements prepare with reinforcement and stockpiling
- Travel between settlements becomes extremely dangerous
- Weather workers are in high demand

**Quiet Season:** Periods of relatively stable atmospheric conditions

- Strong winds are less common
- Optimal time for day-side salvage operations
- Inter-settlement trade increases
- Expansion and construction projects proceed

### Using Wind Mechanically

**Dynamic Scene Tags:**

The GM can introduce or shift wind Tags based on:

- Narrative pacing (introduce storms for dramatic tension)
- Character actions (Weather Working shifts conditions)
- Logical progression (storms build over time, don't appear instantly)
- Player requests (players can suggest wind shifts for dramatic effect)

**Weather Working Interaction:**

When characters use Weather Working to influence wind conditions:

1. Frame a closed question: "Can I calm the gale enough for us to cross safely?"
2. Apply the current wind condition as Risk Dice
3. Apply Weather Working Skill as Chance Die
4. Add situational modifiers (position, environmental support, etc.)
5. Resolve the roll
6. On success, shift the wind Tag one step calmer
7. Apply psychic cost (Psychically Drained Condition for significant shifts)

**Example:**

A superstorm approaches Aetherion settlement. The wind shifts from "Strong Wind" to "Gale" as the system arrives. The weather worker on duty, Thalen kin-Hanga Stormridge, attempts to redirect the worst of it.

- **Current Tag:** "Gale" (+2 Risk Dice)
- **Thalen's Pool:**
  - Weather Working (Skill): +1 Chance Die
  - Positioned on Weather Spire (optimal location): +1 Chance Die
  - Storm Season (opposing force): +1 Risk Die
  - Goal is to protect settlement: +1 Chance Die
- **Net Pool:** 1 Action Die + 1 Chance Die
- **Roll:** Thalen rolls two dice (Action + 1 Chance), gets a 5 and a 3
- **Outcome:** "Yes..." The gale is moderated to "Strong Wind," and the settlement is spared major damage. Thalen gains **Psychically Drained** and will need rest.

## The Deep Roads

The Deep Roads are a vast network of tunnels begun by early human settlers to connect twilight belt settlements to night-side geothermal zones. During the consolidation period of Duskaran civilization, many sections were abandoned due to resource constraints and structural instability. Centuries later, these ancient passages were rediscovered and expanded, incorporating natural cave systems and new excavations. Some sections follow geological formations—underground rivers, lava tubes, fault lines—while others are clearly the work of human engineering.

Exploring the Deep Roads is one of Duskara's signature experiences—equal parts discovery, danger, and mystery.

### Navigation in the Deep Roads

Navigating the Deep Roads uses a **Progress Clock** approach:

1. **Establish the Journey:** Define the destination and distance (near/moderate/far/extreme)
2. **Create a Progress Clock:** Segment the journey into steps (4 segments for near, 6 for moderate, 8 for far, 12 for extreme)
3. **Frame Closed Questions:** At key points, ask questions about progress:
   - "Do we find the correct branch in this junction?"
   - "Can we cross the collapsed section safely?"
   - "Do we notice the unstable rock before it collapses?"
4. **Advance on Success:** Mark segments on the clock for each successful question
   - "Yes, and..." = 2 segments
   - "Yes..." = 1 segment
   - "Yes, but..." = 1 segment (with complication)
5. **Complications on Failure:**
   - "No, but..." = 0 segments (but something good happens)
   - "No..." = 0 segments
   - "No, and..." = 0 segments and crisis

### Deep Roads Hazards

The Deep Roads are not passive tunnels. Hazards are represented as **Scene Tags** that add Risk Dice:

**Structural Hazards:**

- "Unstable Ceiling" (+1 Risk Die to movement and noise)
- "Flooded Passage" (+1 Risk Die to progress, equipment damage risk)
- "Narrow Squeeze" (+1 Risk Die to armored or encumbered characters)
- "Sheer Drop" (+2 Risk Dice without climbing equipment)

**Environmental Hazards:**

- "Freezing Cold" (+1 Risk Die without thermal protection)
- "Toxic Gas" (+2 Risk Dice without respirators)
- "Absolute Darkness" (+1 Risk Die to perception without light or Resonance)
- "Disorienting Acoustics" (+1 Risk Die to Resonance communication)

**Unknown Hazards:**

- "Strange Echoes" (unknown effect until investigated)
- "Shifting Tunnels" (paths that seem to change)
- "Psychic Interference" (disrupts psychic abilities)

### Discovery and Rewards

The Deep Roads contain wonders:

**Geothermal Sites:**

- New vents can support settlements or outposts
- Provides heat, power, mineral deposits

**Ancient Structures:**

- Pre-human architecture of unknown origin
- Potential technology, knowledge, or mysteries

**Lost Caches:**

- Supplies left by previous expeditions
- Salvage from early settlement attempts
- Data crystals with fragmentary records

**Native Ecosystems:**

- Bioluminescent flora and fauna
- Opportunities for Deep Bonding
- Pharmaceutical or nutritional resources

Use discoveries to:

- Advance character Goals
- Improve settlement Resource Tags
- Introduce new mysteries
- Reward bold exploration

### Example Deep Roads Expedition

**Setup:**
The characters are traveling from Aetherion (twilight belt) to Khoros Deep (night-side geothermal settlement). This is a "moderate" journey (6-segment Progress Clock).

**Segment 1: Departure**

- **Question:** "Do we navigate the initial tunnels without incident?"
- **Dice Pool:** 1 Action Die + Chance Dice (Cave Navigation Skill, Wind Compass guidance) - Risk Dice (Absolute Darkness Tag)
- **Result:** "Yes..." → Mark 1 segment

**Segment 2: Junction**

- **Question:** "Can we identify the correct branch using Resonance?"
- **Dice Pool:** 1 Action Die + Chance Dice (Resonance Skill, past experience) - Risk Dice (Disorienting Acoustics Tag)
- **Result:** "No, but..." → Mark 0 segments, but they discover a shortcut (add +1 Chance Die to next roll)

**Segment 3: Flooded Passage**

- **Question:** "Do we cross the flooded section without damaging our equipment?"
- **Dice Pool:** 1 Action Die + Chance Dice (previous shortcut bonus, climbing kit) - Risk Dice (Flooded Passage Tag)
- **Result:** "Yes, but..." → Mark 1 segment, but one character's comm crystal shorts out

**Segments 4-6:** Continue until Progress Clock fills or crisis forces a detour.

## Encounters and Conflicts

*Duskara* is not a combat-focused game, but conflicts—physical, social, or environmental—are inevitable. This section provides structure for resolving meaningful confrontations.

### Conflict Types

#### Physical Confrontation

Direct action between characters or against hostile forces.

**Examples:**

- Defending a settlement from claim-jumpers
- Escaping a collapsing cavern
- Subduing a panicked storm-beast

**Resolution:**

- Frame as closed questions: "Can I disarm the rival before they sabotage the turbine?"
- Apply relevant Tags (combat Skills, environmental factors, opponent's abilities)
- Interpret outcomes narratively, not as hit points

#### Social Confrontation

Persuasion, negotiation, deception, or manipulation.

**Examples:**

- Convincing the Council to fund an expedition
- Negotiating water rights between settlements
- Deceiving a rival about the location of a salvage site

**Resolution:**

- Frame as closed questions: "Can I persuade the Archivists to grant me access to restricted data?"
- Apply relevant Tags (social Skills, Relationships, Nemesis opposition)
- Consider long-term consequences of outcomes

#### Environmental Confrontation

Surviving or overcoming natural hazards.

**Examples:**

- Navigating a superstorm
- Surviving a thermal surge on the day side
- Escaping a collapsing tunnel

**Resolution:**

- Frame as closed questions: "Can we reach shelter before the superstorm hits?"
- Apply environmental zone modifiers and hazard Tags
- Use psychic abilities where appropriate

### Opposition Strength

When facing sapient opposition, their strength is represented by adding Risk Dice:

**Minor Opposition:** +1 Risk Die

- Inexperienced rivals
- Small-scale threats
- Routine challenges

**Moderate Opposition:** +2 Risk Dice

- Skilled opponents
- Organized groups
- Significant hazards

**Major Opposition:** +3 Risk Dice

- Legendary figures
- Elite forces
- Catastrophic threats

NPCs may also have their own Tags (Concept, Skills, Gear) that add additional Risk Dice when relevant.

### Creatures and Native Life

Duskara's native life has adapted to the planet's extreme conditions. Most creatures are not hostile, but they can be dangerous when threatened or when their territories overlap with human activity.

See the **Creatures and Enemies** section for specific examples.

### Zoom In vs. Zoom Out in Conflicts

**Zoom Out:** Resolve the entire confrontation with a single question.

- "Do we drive off the claim-jumpers and secure the mining site?"
- Fast resolution, emphasizes outcome over details
- Best for conflicts where specifics aren't crucial

**Zoom In:** Break the confrontation into multiple questions.

- "Can I identify their leader?"
- "Do I convince the leader to negotiate?"
- "Can I disarm the hostile faction member?"
- Detailed, tense, allows for tactical decisions
- Best for climactic or complex confrontations

Choose based on narrative importance and player engagement.

### Example Conflict

**Situation:** The characters are defending their settlement's water reclamation station from saboteurs hired by a rival settlement.

**Approach:** Zoom In (multiple questions for tension)

**Question 1:** "Can I spot the saboteurs before they reach the pumps?"

- **Dice Pool:** 1 Action Die + Chance Die (Perception Skill, high vantage point) - Risk Die (darkness, saboteurs are experienced)
- **Result:** "Yes, but..." → You spot them, but they see you too and split up

**Question 2:** "Can I intercept the one heading for the main control panel?"

- **Dice Pool:** 1 Action Die + Chance Dice (athleticism, knowledge of station layout) - Risk Dice (saboteur's evasion skill, low light)
- **Result:** "No, but..." → You don't catch them, but you trigger the alarm, alerting the settlement

**Question 3:** "Can I talk the saboteur down before they complete their mission?"

- **Dice Pool:** 1 Action Die + Chance Dice (Relationship with rival settlement, appeals to shared values) - Risk Dice (saboteur's loyalty to employer, time pressure)
- **Result:** "Yes, and..." → The saboteur stands down, and reveals who hired them

### Consequences

Conflicts should have lasting impacts:

**Physical:** Conditions (Injured, Exhausted), gear damage, environmental changes
**Social:** Relationship shifts, reputation changes, new alliances or Nemeses
**Environmental:** Structural damage to settlements, resource status degradation, ecological disruption

## Facilitating Duskara Games

As the Game Master (or "Facilitator" in GM-less play), your role is to voice the world—its settlements, dangers, mysteries, and inhabitants. You're not the author imposing a predetermined narrative. You're the steward of a living world that responds to player choices and reveals itself through shared play.

This section consolidates principles, practical guidance, and specific scenarios for running *Duskara* effectively.

### Core Facilitation Principles

#### 1. The World Is Always Changing

Nothing on Duskara stays fixed. Weather patterns shift. Settlements face new crises. NPCs evolve their goals and positions. People remember what the characters did.

**In Practice:** When characters complete a mission, let it reshape the world. A successful salvage operation improves the settlement's Water Status. A failed negotiation creates new enemies. A rescue creates bonds of loyalty. Make the world responsive—not punishing, but honest about consequences.

#### 2. Ask, Don't Tell

Use questions to invite participation and surprise rather than narrating outcomes. Questions share control with your players and often generate better ideas than you planned.

**Examples:**
- "The storm front is now visible from the settlement. What does the Council decide to do?"
- "You've been living in this settlement for three Cycles. What has made you trust the weather worker who's now asking for your help?"
- "The drone's signal goes dark. What do you think went wrong?"

#### 3. Make Failure Interesting

When characters fail a roll, don't block their story. Open new doors. Failure is an opportunity for complications, plot twists, or unexpected discoveries.

**Examples of reframing failure:**
- "No..." → They fail to convince the Council, but overhear a secret they weren't meant to know
- "No, but..." → The salvage mission fails, but they discover something more valuable instead
- "No, and..." → The negotiation collapses, but it reveals that the opposing settlement has a hidden problem the characters can exploit or help solve

#### 4. Use the Players' Character Tags

Pay attention to what players created:

- **Goals and Motives:** Introduce complications or opportunities that press on these directly. Make characters feel like their driving ambitions matter.
- **Nemeses:** Bring them back. When a character's Nemesis appears, raise the stakes.
- **Relationships:** Use relationships to create drama. A character's mentor might ask for something that conflicts with another character's Goal. A bonded partner might be threatened.
- **Frailties:** When a character's Frailty is relevant to the situation, remind them it exists—and let it matter without punishing them unfairly.

**Example:** Kaelen's Goal is "Recover the *Stellar Horizon*'s navigation core," and their Nemesis is "The Day Side Trading Consortium." Create situations where these intersect: perhaps the Consortium has discovered the same salvage site, or they control access to the day-side margins. This makes Kaelen feel seen and gives their choices real weight.

#### 5. Design NPCs with Contradictions

Don't make NPCs simple. Give every significant NPC at least one contradiction:

- A stern Weather Worker who secretly fears their abilities
- A settlement leader who is politically shrewd but personally lonely
- A rival salvager who competes ruthlessly but honors their debts
- An Archivist who guards secrets fiercely but is desperate to find truth

These contradictions make NPCs memorable and create opportunities for surprising interactions or character arcs.

#### 6. Build Unseen Forces into the World

Plant mysteries early. Duskara is vast, and humanity doesn't understand it fully:

- Strange signals from the Deep Roads
- Ancient structures that appear in satellite images
- Psychic phenomena that resist easy explanation
- Whispered rumors about pre-human civilizations
- Fragments of encrypted data that hint at bigger secrets

Don't explain these immediately. Let them grow. Some mysteries might never be fully resolved—that's okay. The mystery itself is part of the world.

**Critical: Let mysteries evolve based on player engagement.** A mystery you plant is not a story you'll tell. It's a seed. If players ignore it, it remains in the background. If they investigate, it becomes a story thread they're driving forward. If they solve it, what they discover should surprise you as much as them. The mysteries serve the players' emergent story, not the other way around.

### What to Prepare

You don't need extensive prep for *Duskara*, but a little structure helps:

#### 1. Settlements

Define each settlement by:
- **1–2 Key NPCs:** Who matters here? Who do the characters interact with?
- **Current Tension:** What's the settlement dealing with right now? A resource crisis? Political conflict? A recent discovery?
- **Implicit Pressure:** What's the underlying problem or opportunity? Water scarcity? Rivalry with a neighboring settlement? Unexplained phenomena?

#### 2. Maps and Weather

Sketch the territory where play might happen. Don't make it detailed—rough is fine. But know:
- Where's the nearest storm wall?
- What direction does the wind blow?
- Are there geothermal zones nearby?
- What's the current weather condition?

Weather can change during play, especially if characters use Weather Working.

#### 3. NPCs with Relationships

When you introduce a major NPC, jot down:
- A visible strength
- A hidden fault or fear
- A specific relationship to the character(s) or settlement

This is usually 3-4 sentences. Don't over-prepare.

#### 4. Complications

Have a few complications in mind that you can introduce when the story needs tension:
- Environmental hazards (superstorm brewing, thermal surge, structural collapse)
- Social pressure (faction conflict, betrayal, competing interests)
- Resource pressure (water status degrades, supply caravan delays)
- Timing pressure (character's deadline, settlement's crisis, Nemesis appears)

You don't need to plan exactly when these occur. Introduce them when the fiction calls for it.

### NPC Creation and Archetypes

#### Improvise NPCs on the Spot

When an NPC needs to appear, create them in seconds:

- **Concept:** What's their role? (merchant, settlement leader, rival salvager, worker)
- **Visible trait:** One thing you can describe (nervous hands, commanding presence, weathered face)
- **One complication:** One thing that makes them interesting (loyal but harsh, skilled but afraid, friendly but hiding something)

That's it. You don't need a full character sheet. You need enough to know how they respond when challenged.

**Example:** A merchant appears. Concept: salvage trader. Visible trait: scarred hands. Complication: desperate to offload cursed salvage before anyone realizes it's defective. Now you can play them honestly.

**On NPCs and Emergent Play:** The key to letting NPCs drive emergent play is this: **don't predetermine how they'll respond to player actions.** Create them with a concept, trait, and complication, then let them react authentically to what players do. Their contradictions will naturally create interesting moments without requiring scripting. If an NPC is "friendly but hiding something," let the players' questions and actions determine what gets revealed and when. You're not protecting a secret—you're playing a person who has one.

### Running Without Prep

You don't need extensive preparation to facilitate *Duskara*. The game is designed for emergent play, and you have all the tools you need right in the rulebook.

#### You Have Enough Already

Start with what you know:

- **The setting:** You know Duskara. The Twilight Belt has settlements, wind, geothermal vents, salvage opportunities. The Deep Roads are dark and mysterious. The day side is lethal heat. This is enough.
- **The characters:** Players have created their Goals, Nemeses, Relationships. Their Tags are adventure hooks. Start there.
- **The tables:** Adventure Tables give you complications, events, encounters, discoveries on demand. Roll and incorporate.
- **The fiction:** What happened last session? What do the characters want now? That's your starting point.

You don't need a detailed plot outline. You don't need a map of every location. You don't need prepared NPCs for every scene.

#### Ask Questions About Character Actions and Intentions

Your job is to ask players what their characters do and why, then describe what happens next.

- "The settlement council meets to discuss the water crisis. What does your character say?"
- "You've arrived at the salvage site. What do you want to accomplish first?"
- "The weather worker is asking for volunteers for a dangerous working. Does your character volunteer? Why or why not?"
- "The rival offers you a deal. How does your character respond?"

Questions are about character action and intention. You describe the world. The players describe what their characters do in it.

#### Use the Adventure Tables

When you need:
- **A complication:** Roll on Expedition Complications
- **A settlement event:** Roll on Settlement Events
- **A discovery:** Roll on Salvage Discoveries
- **A Deep Roads encounter:** Roll on Deep Roads Encounters
- **A psychic phenomenon:** Roll on Psychic Phenomena

These tables exist so you don't have to invent on the spot. Roll and incorporate. The fiction adjusts around the result.

#### Trust Player Choices to Drive the Story

You don't control what happens next. The characters do.

- They want to explore the day side? You describe the heat, the hazards, the landscape. They tell you what they do. You respond to their actions.
- They want to negotiate with a rival settlement? You describe the rival's position and demeanor. They tell you how they respond. You describe the outcome.
- They want to investigate a mystery? You describe what's discoverable. They tell you what they investigate. You use the tables to generate complications and discoveries based on their choices.

The story emerges from what players do, not from what you prepared.

#### When You Don't Know, Decide on the Spot

You don't have to have all the answers ready, but you do need to answer for the world:

- "You're in the Deep Roads. The air is cold and still. The echo of dripping water fills the silence."
- "The storm front moves in. The wind picks up from the day side, carrying heat and dust."
- "The Archivist's expression hardens. She turns away without answering."

You decide what the world does. You don't ask players to help construct it.

#### Minimal Notes Are Enough

Between sessions, jot down:
- What each NPC cares about (one sentence)
- Current settlement Resource Status
- Open story threads
- What surprised you that you might build on next session

That's all. You don't need detailed notes. The players will remind you of what matters.

#### A Session Without Prep

Here's what a session might look like with zero preparation:

1. **Describe where the characters are:** Set the scene
2. **Ask what the characters do:** Open question about their actions
3. **Listen and respond:** Their choices shape what happens
4. **When they roll, interpret the result:** Use the fiction to determine what comes next
5. **When you need complications:** Roll on a table
6. **When an NPC appears:** Create them in 10 seconds (concept, trait, complication)
7. **When you don't know what happens:** Decide what the world does

That's a complete session. No outline needed. No prepared story. Just you describing the world, players describing their characters' actions, and the fiction unfolding between them.

#### The Trust Required

This works because:

- **The setting guides play:** Duskara's harsh reality shapes what's possible. You don't need to script outcomes—the world does
- **Character Tags drive conflict:** Players bring drama through their Goals, Nemeses, Relationships. You don't need to create it
- **Failure and complication fuel adventure:** When rolls fail, the tables give you ideas. Things get interesting without your planning
- **The table is collaborative:** Not in world-building (that's your job), but in responding to outcomes. You're not alone in interpreting what happens

You can facilitate *Duskara* with genuine confidence without preparation. The game is built for exactly this.

### Zoom In and Zoom Out

You have control over narrative focus. Use it to pace your sessions:

**Zoom Out:** Resolve an entire scene with a single closed question.
- "Does the expedition reach the geothermal site before the storm hits?" (one roll)
- Fast, emphasizes outcomes over details
- Best for scenes that aren't emotionally crucial

**Zoom In:** Break a scene into multiple detailed questions.
- "Can I spot the trap before we trigger it?"
- "Do I convince the faction leader to help?"
- "Can I repair the water pump before the pressure ruptures?"
- Slower, more tense, lets players feel agency in details
- Best for climactic or emotionally important moments

Mix zoom levels within a single session to create rhythm.

### Running Your First Session

Your first session is simpler than you think. No elaborate prep needed. The core goal is: everyone creates a character, everyone understands the setting, and everyone plays a scene together.

#### Time Budget

For a first session with 2-4 players:

- **Character Creation:** 30-45 minutes
- **Safety & Expectations (CATS):** 10 minutes
- **First Scene:** 60-90 minutes
- **Total:** 2.5-3 hours

If you have less time, shorten character creation (consider pre-generated characters) or save world-building questions for later.

#### Before You Start

**Have ready:**
- Dice (at least 1d6 per player, ideally in three colors)
- Character sheets or paper for notes
- The Adventure Tables section (you'll reference it)
- A simple settlement concept

**Don't prepare:**
- A detailed plot
- A mapped-out story
- Specific NPC names and histories
- Multiple scenes

You won't need them.

#### Character Creation (30-45 minutes)

Walk players through character creation together. Don't rush it—this is where players invest in their characters.

**Structure:**
1. Explain each tag type briefly (Concept, Skills, Frailty, etc.)
2. Give examples for each
3. Let players create at their own pace
4. Answer questions as they come
5. Have them read their characters aloud when done

**Tip:** Use the Example Character (Kaelen) as a reference model. When someone asks "what should my Skill be?" point to Kaelen's skills.

#### Safety & Expectations (CATS) (10 minutes)

Quick conversation:

- **Concept:** "We're telling a story about people on Duskara, surviving and exploring."
- **Aim:** "We want to have fun, discover what happens, and see how our characters respond to challenges."
- **Tone:** "It's hopeful but real. People die. Communities struggle. But there's also wonder and possibility."
- **Subject Matter:** "We'll explore resource scarcity, environmental danger, conflict, and loss. Are there topics anyone wants to avoid?"

Don't overthink this. It's just alignment.

#### Your First Scene

**Keep it simple:**

1. **Ask an opening question:** "You're in a settlement called Aetherion. The wind turbines have just been damaged by a storm. What brought you here, and how do you react to the news?"

2. **Listen to responses:** Let each character answer. You're learning what they care about.

3. **Describe the world:** "The settlement is busy with repairs. People are worried but moving with purpose. The wind is still strong—the storm might return."

4. **Ask what they do:** "What does your character do right now?"

5. **If they want to roll:** Build their dice pool and let them roll. Simple as that.

6. **Keep moving:** Don't get stuck on details. Something happens; you describe it; they respond.

#### Possible First Scenarios

Pick one that feels right:

**Scenario 1: The Damaged Settlement**
- A superstorm has damaged the settlement's key infrastructure
- Resources are degraded; leadership is making emergency decisions
- Characters are asked to help (or volunteer)
- Simple hook: "Can you help restore the [water system / power grid / structural damage]?"

**Scenario 2: The Arrival**
- Characters are outsiders arriving at a settlement for the first time
- Someone meets them (a contact, an old friend, an NPC with a job offer)
- The settlement has a current problem they might get involved in
- Simple hook: "What brings you to Aetherion? And what do you notice is wrong?"

**Scenario 3: The Crisis**
- A settlement emergency happens while the characters are there
- A caravan vanishes. Someone needs rescue. A failure occurs.
- Characters are nearby and witness it
- Simple hook: "You hear the alarm bells. What do you do?"

**Pick Scenario 1 or 2** for your first session. They're easier to facilitate. Scenario 3 requires more comfort with emergent crisis.

#### Pacing Tips

- **Don't explain all the rules at once.** Teach mechanics as they come up. "When you try something uncertain, we'll roll."
- **After each roll, move the scene forward.** Don't explain outcomes extensively—just say what happens and ask what they do next.
- **A first session has 3-5 scenes maximum.** Each scene is usually one rolled question. That's enough.
- **End when energy drops.** A good first session might wrap after 2-2.5 hours. Leaving people wanting more is better than overstaying.

#### What Happens in Play

You describe → Players respond → You ask what they do → They roll (maybe) → You describe the outcome → Repeat

That's it. You don't need to manage initiative, track detailed positions, or improvise complex NPC dialogues. You just: world, character action, consequence, repeat.

#### Common First Session Mistakes

- **Explaining too much before play starts.** Get to character creation quickly.
- **Preparing too much.** You have enough. Trust it.
- **Trying to introduce all the world details.** Players learn Duskara through play, not exposition.
- **Asking questions about the world.** Describe the world; ask about character actions.
- **Moving too fast.** Give scenes time to breathe. Let players respond and think.

#### Ending the First Session

**End on a moment of clarity or question:**

- Characters have discovered something
- A complication has emerged
- A relationship has shifted
- An NPC has made a request
- A problem is clear

Then: "That's a good place to stop. Next session, we pick up here."

**Don't try to resolve everything.** You're building momentum for session two, not closing a plot.

#### Between Sessions

Make minimal notes:

- What each character cares about (one sentence per character)
- What happened (three bullets)
- What's coming next (one open thread)

That's all you need. Players will remind you of details that matter.

#### Your Second Session

You already know:
- Who the characters are and what they want
- What the settlement is dealing with
- What mystery or problem emerged in session one

That's your starting point. Same structure: describe, ask what they do, roll if needed, move forward.

You're done. You've run Duskara.

### Reinforcing Tone and Managing Play

*Duskara* emphasizes:
- **Wonder and discovery** — The world is vast and mysterious
- **Competence** — Characters are skilled, resourceful, and capable
- **Community** — Settlements and relationships matter more than individual glory
- **Consequence** — Actions ripple outward; nothing is truly isolated
- **Respect for the environment** — Duskara is harsh but not malicious

When facilitating, lean into these. Describe the world with sensory detail. Show how character choices reshape communities. Make NPCs care about the larger world, not just the immediate conflict.

#### Common Facilitation Challenges

**The party is scattered:** Ask each character what they're doing individually, and zoom between them. Use questions to show how their separate actions create consequences for each other.

**No one is engaging with the hooks:** Step back. Ask the table directly: "What does your character care about right now?" Build the next scene around their answers, not your prepared material.

**A player is hogging spotlight:** Use side conversations. Pull focus to quieter characters with questions: "Thalen, while Kaelen is talking with the Council, what are you doing?" Give each character scenes where they're the center.

**Dice results aren't going the way you expected:** Trust the dice. "Yes, and..." and "No, but..." often create better stories than your plan. Follow the fiction—that's where the story lives.

#### Keeping Notes

Track:
- **Resource Status Tags** for the settlement (Water, Power, Provisions)
- **NPC Relationships** that matter to characters
- **Scene Tags** that might carry over (storm fronts, psychic phenomena, structural damage)
- **Character Conditions** that persist between sessions
- **Plot threads** left unresolved

You don't need a formal ledger—a few bullet points per NPC and location are enough. The players will remind you of what they care about.

## Example of Play

This extended example demonstrates how *Duskara* plays at the table, showcasing the interplay of fiction, mechanics, and collaborative storytelling.

### The Setup

**GM:** "You're standing on the observation platform at the top of Aetherion' central spire. The wind is strong—steady at about 60 kilometers per hour—and you can see storm clouds gathering on the day-side horizon. Kaelen, you've been scanning the thermal signatures all morning. What do you see?"

**Kaelen's Player:** "I'm using my Thermal Sense to check if the mining drones are still operational out in the day margins. Have they sent back any signals?"

**GM:** "Good question. Let's frame that as: 'Can you detect the thermal signatures of the drones through the storm interference?' You've got your Thermal Sense Skill, so that's a Chance Die. But there's storm interference building, which adds a Risk Die. Go ahead and roll."

### The Roll

**Kaelen's Player:** "Okay, so one Action Die and one Chance Die minus one Risk Die. That's just the Action Die." *(rolls a 4)* "I got a 4."

**GM:** "Yes, but... You do pick up the drones' signatures—three of them are still active and broadcasting their positions. But the fourth one, the deep-salvage unit, has gone dark. Either it's offline, buried, or something else is interfering. What do you do?"

**Kaelen's Player:** "That's the one with the high-value salvage. I need to go out there and check on it. I'll gear up and head out."

### Scene Transition

**GM:** "All right, you're suiting up in the airlock. Zhiren, you notice Kaelen preparing for a day-side run. What's your reaction?"

**Zhiren's Player:** "I'm going to stop them. 'Kaelen, you know what day-side conditions are like right now. The storm's about to hit, and you've already been Psychically Drained from yesterday's Weather Working. You need rest, not a suicide mission.'"

**Kaelen's Player:** "I look at Zhiren and say, 'The salvage contract pays enough to keep our water systems running for three months. We can't afford to lose that drone. I'll be quick.'"

**GM:** "Okay, this sounds like a social question. Zhiren, are you trying to convince Kaelen to stay? Frame it as a closed question."

**Zhiren's Player:** "Can I convince Kaelen that this mission is too dangerous right now?"

**GM:** "Let's build the pool. You've got a Relationship with Kaelen—you taught them thermal sensing—so that's a Chance Die. But Kaelen's Goal is tied to proving humanity can reclaim what was lost, and their Motive is strong. That's a Risk Die representing their determination. Also, the settlement's water situation is a factor—that's another Risk Die. Roll it."

### Social Conflict

**Zhiren's Player:** *(rolls 1 Action Die + 1 Chance Die - 2 Risk Dice = just the Action Die)* "I got a 2."

**GM:** "No... Kaelen, Zhiren's argument doesn't sway you. You're too focused on the mission and what it means for the settlement. Zhiren, you see the determination in their eyes—they're going."

**Kaelen's Player:** "I nod to Zhiren. 'I'll be back before the storm hits. Keep the weather spire active—I might need you to clear a path home.' Then I head into the airlock."

### Day-Side Expedition

**GM:** "Okay, Kaelen, you're now outside in the day margins. It's blazing hot even in twilight's shadow, and the temperature is climbing as you move toward the salvage coordinates. You're in the Day Side zone now, so that's an automatic +2 Risk Dice to all physical actions. Your Heavy-Duty Thermal Suit reduces that by 1, and your Thermal Suit Operation Skill gives you a Chance Die. What's your first move?"

**Kaelen's Player:** "I'm using Thermal Sense to track the drone's last known position. Can I find it through the thermal noise?"

**GM:** "Good. Frame the question."

**Kaelen's Player:** "Can I locate the disabled drone using Thermal Sense?"

**GM:** "Let's build it:

- 1 Action Die
- Thermal Sense Skill: +1 Chance Die
- Survival (Day Side): +1 Chance Die
- Heavy-Duty Thermal Suit: +1 Chance Die
- Day Side zone: +1 Risk Die (reduced from +2 by your suit)
- Overconfident in Their Abilities (Frailty): +1 Risk Die (you're pushing too hard)
- Net pool: 1 Action Die + 2 Chance Dice"

**Kaelen's Player:** *(rolls three dice: 5, 4, 3)* "I got a 5."

**GM:** "Yes... You locate the drone. It's half-buried in a thermal vent collapse, about 200 meters ahead. The salvage container is intact, and you can extract it. But the heat is intensifying—you estimate you have maybe thirty minutes before your suit's cooling system is overwhelmed. What do you do?"

**Kaelen's Player:** "I move toward it and start digging it out. Can I recover the salvage container before my suit fails?"

### Escalation

**GM:** "That's the critical question. Let's zoom in a bit. First, can you reach the drone without overheating?"

**Kaelen's Player:** "Okay. Same pool as before?"

**GM:** "Almost. The heat is even more intense now, so add another Risk Die for 'Scorching Heat.' That's 1 Action Die + 2 Chance Dice - 1 Risk Die (net)."

**Kaelen's Player:** *(rolls three dice: 6, 3, 2)* "A 6!"

**GM:** "Yes, and... You not only reach the drone, but you find a thermal shadow—a small outcrop that shields you from the worst of the heat. You can work from there, which removes the extra Risk Die. Now, can you extract the salvage container?"

**Kaelen's Player:** "Let's do it. Can I free the salvage container before the storm hits?"

**GM:** "You're working against time now. The storm front is visible on the horizon, and the wind is picking up. That's:

- 1 Action Die
- Ancient Technology Skill: +1 Chance Die
- Thermal Lance (Gear): +1 Chance Die
- Scorching Heat: +1 Risk Die
- Storm Front Approaching: +1 Risk Die
- Net pool: 1 Action Die + 1 Chance Die"

**Kaelen's Player:** *(rolls two dice: 4, 4)* "Two 4s!"

**GM:** "Two of the same highest value—that shifts the result one step better. You got 'Yes...' which becomes 'Yes, and...' You free the salvage container, and as you pull it loose, you notice something else—a data crystal embedded in the wreckage, partially intact. It looks like it might be from the *Stellar Horizon* itself. Do you take it?"

**Kaelen's Player:** "Absolutely. I grab both and start heading back."

### The Return

**GM:** "Back in Aetherion, Zhiren, you're on the weather spire watching the storm roll in. The wind has jumped to gale force—that's +2 Risk Dice to outdoor actions. You can see Kaelen's heat signature through your comm link, moving toward the settlement, but the storm is closing fast. If they don't get inside soon, they'll be caught in it."

**Zhiren's Player:** "I'm using Weather Working to push back the storm front, just enough to give Kaelen a window to get through. Can I redirect the worst of the storm for a few minutes?"

**GM:** "That's a big ask. The storm is massive. Let's build the pool:

- 1 Action Die
- Weather Working Skill: +1 Chance Die
- Positioned on Weather Spire: +1 Chance Die
- Relationship with Kaelen (you trained them): +1 Chance Die
- Gale Force Winds (scene Tag): +2 Risk Dice
- Storm Season: +1 Risk Die
- Psychically Drained (from yesterday): +1 Risk Die
- Net pool: 1 Action Die + 0 Chance Dice (everything cancels)"

**Zhiren's Player:** *(rolls the Action Die: 5)* "Just a 5."

**GM:** "Yes... You manage it. The storm front hesitates, pushed back just long enough for Kaelen to sprint through the outer gates. But the effort costs you—you collapse on the spire platform, utterly exhausted. You're gaining the Condition 'Severely Psychically Drained,' which will take days of rest to clear. Kaelen makes it inside as the storm slams into Aetherion' shields."

### Resolution

**GM:** "Kaelen, you're back in the airlock, covered in dust and sweat, but you've got the salvage container and the data crystal. Zhiren, you're being helped down from the spire by other weather workers. What do you both do?"

**Kaelen's Player:** "I find Zhiren as soon as I'm cleaned up. 'You saved my life. Thank you.' I hand them the data crystal. 'I think this might be important.'"

**Zhiren's Player:** "I take it, too tired to even smile. 'Next time, listen when I tell you something's too dangerous. But... good work.'"

**GM:** "The salvage contract will keep Aetherion' water systems running, improving the settlement's Water Status from 'Water Rationing' to 'Water Adequate.' And the data crystal—well, that's a mystery for another session. For now, you've both earned some rest."

---

**What This Example Demonstrates:**

- **Fiction-first play:** The story drives the mechanics, not the other way around
- **Closed questions:** Every roll is framed clearly
- **Tag interaction:** Skills, Gear, Frailties, environmental zones, and Relationships all influence rolls
- **Zone modifiers:** The Day Side automatically adds Risk Dice
- **Psychic costs:** Weather Working had narrative consequences
- **Collaborative storytelling:** Players and GM build the scene together
- **Emergent narrative:** The data crystal discovery came from rolling well, opening new story threads

**A Note on Scene Narration:** In the Scene Transition, the GM said, "Zhiren, you notice Kaelen preparing for a day-side run." This is a common and effective way to present the world. But Zhiren retained full agency—they could have ignored Kaelen, done something else entirely, or reacted differently. The GM describes the world; players decide how their characters engage with it. Alternatively, Zhiren's player could have declared what they were doing first, and the GM would respond. The point is: describing what a character notices is not the same as narrating what they do. Narration of the world is the GM's job. Agency to respond is the player's.

## Adventure Design

*Duskara* adventures emerge from the setting's inherent tensions and opportunities. This section provides frameworks, settlement templates, and inspiration for building engaging campaigns.

### Design Philosophy

#### Player Choice and Consequence

Your role is not to railroad players toward a predetermined narrative. Instead, establish a world full of opportunities and tensions, then let player choices determine what happens. Consequences should flow naturally from their decisions—not as punishment, but as honest reflection of how the world responds.

Adventures work best when they arise from:
- **Character Tags:** Goals, Nemeses, and Relationships are built-in adventure hooks
- **Settlement Pressures:** Current Tensions and Implicit Pressures create natural conflicts
- **Duskara's Harshness:** Environmental challenges and resource scarcity drive urgency
- **Inter-Settlement Relations:** The Accord and regional politics create opportunity for drama

#### The Duskaran Accord in Play

The Duskaran Accord is a loose confederation of settlements established in Cycle 7,306 to manage inter-settlement relations, resource distribution, and collective defense. It's not a government but a framework for cooperation.

**Accord Structure:**
- **The Wind and Water Assembly:** Annual gathering of settlement delegates to address shared concerns
- **Wayseers:** Neutral psychic adepts who mediate disputes
- **Wind Riders:** Couriers and envoys traveling between settlements
- **Resource Arbitrators:** Specialists adjudicating conflicts over shared resources
- **Storm Wardens:** Elite weather workers protecting multiple settlements

**Accord Principles:**
- Mutual Aid (settlements assist during crises)
- Fair Trade (resources exchanged at agreed rates)
- Dispute Resolution (negotiation, not violence)
- Knowledge Sharing (discoveries shared across settlements)
- Environmental Stewardship (ecosystems protected from exploitation)

**Accord Tensions:**
Not every settlement honors the Accord equally. Common conflicts include:
- Resource Competition (rival claims over geothermal sites, water, salvage)
- Isolationism (some settlements prefer self-reliance)
- Cultural Differences (twilight belt vs. night-side values)
- Power Imbalances (larger settlements dominate negotiations)
- Secret-Keeping (settlements withhold discoveries for advantage)

**Adventure Hooks from the Accord:**
- Diplomatic Missions (represent your settlement in negotiations)
- Resource Disputes (mediate or escalate conflicts)
- Storm Response (coordinate multi-settlement efforts)
- Archival Quests (recover knowledge for collective good)
- Enforcement Actions (investigate Accord violations)

### Settlement Creation

Settlements are the anchors of *Duskara* play. They provide context, resources, conflicts, and consequences. You don't need extensive detail—a simple template is enough.

#### Settlement Template

**Name & Location:**
- *Example: Aetherion (Twilight Belt, central position)*

**Character (1-2 sentences):**
- What's distinctive about this settlement? What defines it?
- *Example: Aetherion is a vertical spire city built around geothermal vents. Water is carefully rationed but plentiful; power abundant. Politics are rigid but fair.*

**Key NPCs (1-2):**
- Name, role, one complication
- *Example: Councilor Thessan kin-Babu Rynthar (administrator, afraid of losing control) / Archivist Sorahn kin-Babu Daemir (preserves pre-landing data, obsessive about lost knowledge)*

**Current Resource Status:**
- Water: [Abundant / Adequate / Rationing / Crisis]
- Power: [Full Grid / Adequate / Rolling Blackouts / Failure]
- Provisions: [Well-Supplied / Adequate / Running Low / Critical Shortage]

**Current Tension (what's happening now):**
- What problem or opportunity is the settlement facing?
- *Example: Aquifer pumps are failing. The council debates whether to fund repairs or accept rationing.*

**Implicit Pressure (underlying issue):**
- What's the deeper problem beneath the immediate crisis?
- *Example: The geothermal vents have cooled over the past generation. No one admits it publicly.*
- **On Implicit Pressure:** This is not a hidden secret you're protecting. It's a world condition that might emerge through play if players investigate the settlement's problems or if circumstances naturally reveal it. If players never dig into the settlement's history or politics, the implicit pressure stays in the background. If they do investigate, let them uncover this reality honestly. The pressure creates interesting drama when it surfaces—not because you're revealing a plot twist, but because it makes the world feel real and consequential.

**Relationships to Other Settlements:**
- How does this settlement relate to neighbors?
- *Example: Tense alliance with Harmattan's Reach (competing for water resources) / Trading partnership with Khoros Deep (geothermal technology)*

**A Few Useful Details:**
- Architecture/visual: One distinctive feature
- Culture/values: What matters to people here?
- Safety: Is it stable? Dangerous? Prosperous?

### Example: Aetherion

**Name & Location:** Aetherion, Twilight Belt (central position, day-side margins accessible)

**Character:** A vertical spire city built around geothermal vents. Architecture emphasizes height—towers reach into the wind currents, deep foundations tap heat. Water is precious but available; power abundant. Politics are hierarchical but fair.

**Key NPCs:**
- **Councilor Thessan kin-Babu Rynthar** (settlement administrator; afraid of losing control, makes decisions conservatively)
- **Archivist Sorahn kin-Babu Daemir** (preserves pre-landing data; obsessive about recovering lost knowledge, will risk settlement resources for discoveries)

**Current Resource Status:**
- Water: Adequate (but precarious; aquifer pumps are aging)
- Power: Full Grid (geothermal vents are reliable)
- Provisions: Well-Supplied (trade relationships stable)

**Current Tension:** Aquifer pumps are failing. Thessan wants to defer repairs and accept rationing. Sorahn argues the settlement should invest in new deep-drilling technology discovered in the archives. The council debates while the pumps degrade further.

**Implicit Pressure:** The geothermal vents have been cooling for three generations. No one admits it publicly. If the decline continues, Aetherion's advantage disappears.

**Relationships:**
- **Harmattan's Reach** (rival): Competing for the same aquifer. Relationship is tense but governed by Accord protocols.
- **Khoros Deep** (ally): Trade partnership for geothermal extraction technology.
- **Nomadic traders**: Regular visitors; Aetherion offers supplies; travelers bring news.

**Distinctive Details:**
- Architecture: Spire towers with wind-capture systems; deep foundations in thermal caverns
- Culture: Values precision and order; slow to trust outsiders; honor long-term relationships
- Safety: Stable and defended; storms rarely penetrate the spire system; day-side salvagers operate from here

### Example: Khoros Deep

**Name & Location:** Khoros Deep, Night Side (geothermal settlement, 400 meters beneath surface)

**Character:** An underground city built around massive geothermal vents. Darkness is absolute; bioluminescent life lights the caverns. Culture is collectivist and ritual-focused. Temperature is warm but carefully managed. People are adaptable, resilient, suspicious of surface dwellers.

**Key NPCs:**
- **Warmth Mother Seren** (leader of the Geothermal Circle; wise and patient, but unwilling to change tradition)
- **Kai the Resonance Singer** (young, ambitious; wants to expand trade with twilight settlements; challenges Seren's conservatism)

**Current Resource Status:**
- Water: Abundant (geothermal aquifers provide unlimited fresh water)
- Power: Full Grid (geothermal vents power everything; energy is unlimited)
- Provisions: Adequate (food sources from cave ecosystems are limited; relies on trade)

**Current Tension:** Kai argues Khoros should trade more aggressively with twilight settlements, offering geothermal technology in exchange for surface goods. Seren fears this will expose the settlement's secrets and invite exploitation.

**Implicit Pressure:** The cave ecosystem that feeds Khoros is slowly collapsing due to human harvesting. The geothermal vents, while plentiful, heat some areas to dangerous levels. Long-term survival requires expansion or adaptation.

**Relationships:**
- **Aetherion** (trade partner): Khoros supplies geothermal extraction technology; Aetherion provides food, textiles, Earth artifacts.
- **Other night-side settlements** (cooperative): Share geothermal resources and knowledge; participate in Warmth Circles.
- **Twilight belt settlements** (wary): Surface dwellers are unpredictable; trade is necessary but limited.

**Distinctive Details:**
- Architecture: Carved into cavern walls; bioluminescent gardens cultivated for food and light; thermal pools for warmth and ritual
- Culture: Deeply ritualistic; Resonance singing is sacred; collectivism valued over individuality; suspicious of haste
- Safety: Well-defended by knowledge of cavern systems; geothermal hazards are the real danger; rarely visited by outsiders

#### Using This Template

Create a settlement in minutes:

1. **Give it a name and location** — Where is it? What zone?
2. **Describe its character** — One or two sentences capturing its feel
3. **Add 1-2 NPCs** — Name, role, one complication each
4. **Set Resource Status** — Simple tags showing current scarcity
5. **Define the tension** — What's happening now?
6. **Name the pressure** — What's the underlying issue?
7. **Add relationships** — How does it connect to other places?
8. **Add details** — A few lines about what it's like

That's a complete, playable settlement. You have enough to facilitate scenes there and improvise what happens. You don't need detailed histories, complete NPC rosters, or maps. You need enough to know what's at stake when the characters arrive.

### Core Adventure Structures

#### Exploration and Discovery

**Hook:** A new geothermal site, ancient structure, or unexplored Deep Roads branch beckons.

**Tension:** Environmental hazards, rival expeditions, resource limitations.

**Resolution:** What do the characters find? How does it change their settlement or understanding of Duskara?

**Example Seeds:**

- A satellite transmission reveals coordinates to a structure of unknown origin in the day margins
- Seismic readings suggest a massive geothermal complex beneath the Deep Roads
- A nomad reports finding a cavern filled with bioluminescent life and strange carvings

#### Resource Crisis

**Hook:** A settlement's Water, Power, or Provision status degrades to critical levels.

**Tension:** Time pressure, competing settlements, environmental obstacles.

**Resolution:** How do the characters secure resources? What sacrifices or compromises are required?

**Example Seeds:**

- A superstorm damages the settlement's primary wind turbines
- Aquifer pumps fail due to sabotage or malfunction
- A supply caravan vanishes in the Deep Roads

#### Inter-Settlement Conflict

**Hook:** Two or more settlements clash over resources, territory, or ideology.

**Tension:** Loyalty, ethics, political maneuvering.

**Resolution:** Do the characters escalate or de-escalate the conflict? What alliances form or break?

**Example Seeds:**

- Rival settlements claim the same geothermal vent
- A settlement refuses to share a critical technological breakthrough
- A rogue faction threatens to destabilize the Accord

#### Psychic Mystery

**Hook:** Strange psychic phenomena, Awakening events, or inexplicable occurrences.

**Tension:** Unknown forces, psychological stakes, potential danger to bonded individuals.

**Resolution:** What is the source of the phenomenon? How do the characters respond?

**Example Seeds:**

- Multiple weather workers experience identical visions during a storm
- A character's Deep Bonding partner begins behaving erratically
- The Deep Roads emit psychic interference that disrupts resonance communication

#### Salvage and Archaeology

**Hook:** High-value salvage sites, historical artifacts, or technological breakthroughs await recovery.

**Tension:** Environmental danger, rival salvagers, ethical questions about the past.

**Resolution:** What do the characters retrieve? What does it reveal about Earth or Duskara?

**Example Seeds:**

- Data suggests the *Stellar Horizon*'s navigation core survived the crash
- An Archivist hires the characters to recover a data crystal from a collapsed archive
- Strange structures in the night-side caverns may contain technology of unknown origin

### Building Sessions

Every adventure needs clear structure:

**Start with a Hook:** Present a problem, opportunity, or mystery that engages player characters based on their Tags

**Establish Stakes:** What happens if the characters fail or don't act? Why should they care?

**Introduce Complications:** Layer on environmental hazards, rival interests, moral dilemmas, or resource pressure to create tension

**Allow Player Agency:** Characters should have multiple valid approaches to problems, not a single "correct" solution

**Resolve with Consequences:** Outcomes should change the world. Success improves settlement status or advances a character's Goal. Failure creates new obstacles or reveals dangers.

This structured approach works well for designed scenes. Alternatively, you can facilitate more organically—see "Running Without Prep" in the Facilitating section for a completely improvisational style where the world responds to player choices without predetermined session structures. Both approaches honor the core principle: player choices drive the story.

### Campaign Frameworks

What shape should your campaign take? These frameworks provide starting points, but they're guidelines, not scripts. Player choices will reshape them into something uniquely your campaign's.

#### 1. The Twilight Frontier

**Focus:** Settlement building and regional expansion

Characters are settlers establishing a new outpost in contested territory or expanding an existing settlement's influence. The campaign revolves around survival, resource acquisition, and navigating relationships with neighboring settlements.

**Typical Sessions:**
- Establishing the outpost's infrastructure and defenses
- Securing resource supplies and trade relationships
- Negotiating or competing with neighboring settlements
- Responding to environmental crises (storms, equipment failures)
- Integrating with (or resisting) the broader Accord

**Key Mechanics:**
- Settlement Resource Status becomes central (water, power, provisions)
- Character Goals often tie to the settlement's success
- Relationships with neighboring settlements matter greatly

**Typical Themes:** Community building, resource management, environmental adaptation, collective responsibility

#### 2. Echoes of Earth

**Focus:** Historical mystery and discovery

Characters are Archivists, scholars, or explorers piecing together the lost history of the *Stellar Horizon* and Earth's final days. The campaign is driven by curiosity, revelation, and the tension between preserving knowledge and using it wisely.

**Typical Sessions:**
- Investigating satellite transmissions or pre-landing records
- Mounting expeditions to recover data crystals or archives
- Decoding encrypted Earth-era technology
- Discovering implications of what was lost (and why)
- Navigating ethical questions about dangerous knowledge

**Key Mechanics:**
- Salvage Discoveries often advance the mystery
- Relationships with Archivists and institutions become crucial
- Character Nemeses might involve those wanting to suppress knowledge

**Typical Themes:** Mystery, legacy, identity, the tension between past and present, burden of knowledge

#### 3. Storm Riders

**Focus:** Travel, diplomacy, and inter-settlement conflict

Characters are Wind Riders or wanderers traveling between settlements to mediate conflicts, deliver messages, trade, or respond to emergencies. Each location presents new challenges and opportunities.

**Typical Sessions:**
- Traveling between settlements (using Deep Roads or surface routes)
- Negotiating disputes between rival settlements
- Delivering urgent messages during crises
- Responding to emergencies in unfamiliar settlements
- Uncovering larger patterns in regional conflicts

**Key Mechanics:**
- Multiple settlements become familiar locations with recurring NPCs
- Character Relationships expand across the region
- Travel rolls (Progress Clocks) create tension and discovery

**Typical Themes:** Travel, diplomacy, heroism, interconnectedness, the broader political landscape

#### 4. Deep Roads Delvers

**Focus:** Exploration and subterranean discovery

Characters are professional explorers, archaeologists, or salvagers mapping and exploiting the Deep Roads. The campaign emphasizes mystery, danger, and the unknown.

**Typical Sessions:**
- Mounting expeditions into uncharted Deep Roads sections
- Discovering ancient structures or geothermal sites
- Surviving environmental hazards (cold, darkness, instability)
- Encountering native life or psychic phenomena
- Surfacing to manage discoveries and plan next expeditions

**Key Mechanics:**
- Progress Clocks and environmental hazards become central
- Salvage Discoveries often reveal deeper mysteries
- Psychic phenomena might escalate over the campaign

**Typical Themes:** Exploration, danger, discovery, the planet's hidden secrets, unknown forces
